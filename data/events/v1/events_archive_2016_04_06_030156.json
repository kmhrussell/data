Estimation, a simple word with so many interpretations and uses. Add the word Agile and the confusion is guaranteed. Some of the common questions are : Is commitment? A date? A prediction? A guess? What is it anyway ? How do we do it ? Are there reliable techniques ? Estimates are always wrong, why do we need them ? Do you want to know more about it ? Are you puzzled about it ? Do you know techniques that could help others ? Would you like to share experiences ? Do you have a burning question ? Come over and join us !

The DEF CON Groups (DCGs or DC-Groups) are a gathering point for folks interested in the alternate applications of modern technology, referred to properly as 'hacking'. DCGs are not intended to compete with any other computer groups, such as 2600, but rather to provide yet another gathering place for the discussion of technology and security topics. DCG meetings are open to anyone, regardless of their skill, age, job, gender, etc. DCGs are designed to help you learn new things, meet new people, mentor others in areas you may be strong in, and provide some cohesion within the hacker culture and it's members.","location":"HackerspaceSG","rsvp_count":43,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/556764441151153","group_id":"121463986679","group_name":"HackerspaceSG","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/121463986679","formatted_time":"06 Apr 2016, Wed, 8:00 pm","start_time":"2016-04-06T12:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-04-06T14:00:00.000Z"}]}
