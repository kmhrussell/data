Expect top notch talks, hands on labs, takeouts, and fancy-ish nibbles (Not pizza). What's new with Xamarin - Ben Ishiyama-Levy Let's go through the newest and bestest features Xamarin provides at the time of this talk, with a glimpse at what's coming next. PCL Cross Platform Images in Xamarin.Forms - Udara Alwis Xamarin Forms allows us to share a single code base among all three platforms. But when it comes to managing Image Resources, Xamarin Forms doesn't provide a unified solution, whereas we have to manage Image Resource individually for each platform natively considering the scalability and multi-resolution support. Forms9Patch enhances Xamarin Forms to enable multi-resolution image management for iOS and Android. Simply put with Forms9Patch allows you to manage your Image Resources right from your PCL project, which also provides full support for multi-resolution resource handling and automatically takes care of it under the hood. Using Charts in Xamarin - Sohel In some cases, Charts &amp; Graphs are essential components to visualize data and now they are getting used widely in Mobile Apps as well. We will have a look at the options available to do it in Xamarin Apps with some samples.","location":"Microsoft Auditorium (Singapore), One Marina Boulevard, Level 21 Auditorium, Singapore 018989 ","rsvp_count":12,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Xamarin-SG/events/232464703/","group_id":19887921,"group_name":"Singapore Xamarin User group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Xamarin-SG","formatted_time":"13 Jul 2016, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-07-13T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-07-13T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.282387,"longitude":103.85244},{"id":"232440191","name":"BTC in SG Meetup - Digital Identity, can it save lives?","description":"Eric Alexander will be giving a presentation of how blockchain can be used to save lives, and what level of privacy we have to give up to make this work. ex: Can we use blockchain to reference blood donors patients and give hospital an access to live donors within their area?

About Khai Seng \"I have the pleasure of leading the Foolproof Singapore team. I help craft creative and effective approaches for clients and make sure that the project teams deliver quality work that addresses both business and customer needs. I've been in the user experience design field for the past 11 years. My primary skill-set includes design research and interaction design. Throughout my career, I have facilitated many workshops and training programmes with C-suite executives and working professionals to drive cultural change within organisations around design and innovation. I'm a firm believer in holistic experience design spanning digital, spatial, product and service domains. I feel that delivering great design for a client is only part of the equation. It is also key to help clients bring sustained impact and cultural change in the way they work.\" Agenda for the night 7pm – 7.30pm: Registration and networking 7.30pm – 8.30pm: Conversation with Khai Seng 8.30pm – 9pm: Networking and drinks :) We're hoping to keep the session really informal and casual where it is more conversational centric so bring along some of your burning questions to the session. The value of the meetup is as good as the questions asked :) Also, if you would like to ask the question privately, please email me at kiat@ixda.sg and I'll ask them on your behalf :) Alternatively, feel free to tweet us the questions to @IxDASG and we can have that answered!","location":"Rocky Master Cafe, 402 North Bridge Road, Jun Xin Building, Singapore 188722","rsvp_count":100,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/IxDA-Singapore/events/231539044/","group_id":2725412,"group_name":"IxDA Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/IxDA-Singapore","formatted_time":"13 Jul 2016, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-07-13T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-07-13T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.29646,"longitude":103.85438}]}
