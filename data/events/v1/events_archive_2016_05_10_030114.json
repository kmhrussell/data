She was helping out at Maker Faire last year and noticed that there were a lot of booths showcasing the drones that were built. After Maker Faire, there was an open call for applications to OneMaker Groupâ€™s Apprenticeship Programme and it was then that she decided to jump into the Drone bandwagon and used that opportunity try and build a drone from scratch.\n \nParticipants will get to know more about drones from Syab's perspective and how you can get start making your own drone!\n \nThere will also be a Q&A session after the talk.\n\nRegister Here\nhttps://www.eventbrite.sg/e/creative-crew-talks-may-meeting-2016-tickets-25224401865","location":"Toa Payoh Public Library, 6 Toa Payoh Central, Singapore 319191","rsvp_count":23,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1708189206120200","group_id":"14431580201","group_name":"Creative Crew Singapore","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/14431580201","formatted_time":"10 May 2016, Tue, 6:45 pm","start_time":"2016-05-10T10:45:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-05-10T12:30:00.000Z","latitude":1.3337125632578,"longitude":103.85052593821}]}
