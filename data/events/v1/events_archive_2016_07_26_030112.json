I run my own training and consulting business, Return and Risk Consulting Pte Ltd in Singapore, and am a private trader and investor. I have a MSc in Financial Engineering, am a CFA charterholder and certified FRM.I have a keen interest in financial markets and in applying the theory to make better investment decisions. • 8:00pm - 8:50pm Presentation: Big Data and Machine Learning on Google Cloud Platform by Lak Lakshmanan (Google Hangout) One of the primary purposes of practical data analysis is to enable better decisions to be made.  In this talk, I will take a decision that needs to be made, and apply different statistical and machine learning methods to gain insight into making that decision in a data-driven manner.  Along the way, I will also take you on a tour of the Big Data and Machine Learning parts of the Google Cloud Platform. Speaker: I am currently a Program Manager for the Google Cloud Platform.  My mission is to democratize machine learning so that it can be done by anyone anywhere  using Google's amazing infrastructure (i.e., without deep knowledge of statistics or programming or ownership of lots of hardware).  Previously as a Director at the Climate Corporation, I led a team of data scientists (statisticians, engineers, meteorologists) who build probabilistic estimates of past, current and future weather. Before that, I was a Senior Research Scientist at CIMMS/U. Oklahoma/National Severe Storms Laboratory. My Google Scholar page captures the ways in which that work is used by other scientists.

Machine builder Kiwi would be doing a reverse teardown of a CO2 laser cutter right here at OMG!\n\nLaser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the material or the laser beam generated.\n\nCommon uses are cutting and engraving patterns onto material such as wood, leather and acrylic, and is considered one of the faster processes in rapid prototyping. Join us for this sharing session to demystify the laser cutter machine!\n\nBiography\n\nKiwi Teng is an innovative machine designer and builder, and has worked on a multitude of fabrication machines, including a CNCs, 3D Printers, vacuum formers and laser cutters.\nDismayed by the slow decline of manufacturing capabilities in Singapore, he set out create an example by building a machine in 6 months with limited resources and knowledge, able to do additive, subtractive, forming and cutting manufacturing, and showcased it at Makerfaire 2016. He hopes to inspire and encourage others in Singapore to adopt the same innovative Maker spirit that built early Singapore!\n\nTECH BOLEH TAHAN is the rebooted series of informative talks and informal sharing sessions hosted by professionals in the technology, arts and design fields. Our goal is to provide a platform on a wide range of subject matters to foster learning, sharing, inspiration and wonder.

Apache Apex Data Ingestion is a standalone big data application that simplifies the collection, aggregation and movement of large amounts of data to and from Hadoop for a more efficient data processing pipeline. Apache Apex Data Ingestion makes configuring and running Hadoop data ingestion and data extraction a point and click process enabling a smooth, easy path to your Hadoop-based big data project. In this series of talks, we would cover how Hadoop Ingestion is made easy using Apache Apex. The second talk in this series would focus on ingesting unbounded data from Kafka to HDFS with couple of processing operators - Transform and enrichment. Please register for the webinar at: https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/7618094232313821699 After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the webinar. Apache Apex is a next generation native Hadoop data in motion platform that is being used by customers for both streaming as well as batch processing. Common use cases include ingestion into Hadoop, streaming analytics, ETL, database off-loads, alerts and monitoring, machine model scoring, etc. Apache Apex completely separates operational logic from business logic, and handles all operational aspects. This enables developers to concentrate on business logic and reduce time to market as well as total cost of ownership.  For deeper engagement with Apache Apex - follow ApacheApex, presentations, recordings, download (community, sandbox), Apache Apex releases, docs  This webcast is of an Apache Apex meetup event done earlier in Pune, IN and we are webcasting it enable other BigFoots to participate. ","location":"Webcast, Online, Singapore","rsvp_count":18,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Apache-Apex-Singapore/events/232594236/","group_id":20147631,"group_name":"Apache Apex Next Gen Native Hadoop Big Data, Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Apache-Apex-Singapore","formatted_time":"26 Jul 2016, Tue, 10:30 pm","start_time":"2016-07-26T14:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-07-26T15:45:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.355379,"longitude":103.867744}]}
