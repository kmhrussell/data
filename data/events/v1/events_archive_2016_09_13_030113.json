Machine learning has changed the way we interact and use real-world data to provide insights that are otherwise not directly available for us to leverage. In this talk, we will discuss how we could design our own machine learning system with Google's TensorFlow and take a look at how to perform prediction, classify images and text using the TensorFlow API.  Bio: Karthik graduated from NTU Singapore with a PhD, where his topic of research was computer vision for multimedia broadcast and consumption. Some of his research interests include end-to-end deep learning for object detection &amp; recognition and 3D vision. Python is his go-to language for any task related to vision and machine learning for its ease of prototyping and speed. Lucky draw from our sponsors at O'Reilly.
