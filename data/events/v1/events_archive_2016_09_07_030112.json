This will also have an introduction and demo, to allow you to learn new technologies and features. Afterwards, please feel free to stick around for the AWS UG, which will be in the evening of the same day. Reasons to attend • Learn how you can use AWS more easy and effectively  • Learn Cloud Native usage of AWS  • Chance to get to know a Japanese tech company Who should attend • Anyone who interested in cloud services  • Business managers who would like to gain a greater understanding of cloud technology  • Developers, IT Managers or Business owners seeking to understand the basics of AWS  • Fans of AWS!! Agenda 1:00PM Admission starts 2:00PM - 5:00PM Cloud Automator (https://cloudautomator.com/en/) Cloud Automator is the best tool to automate Amazon Web Services (AWS) operations - such as EBS backup, start and stop EC2 instances. Use Case 1. Stop Development EC2 instances outside of work hours to save on cost. 2. Create EBS snapshot every week. 3. Create EC2 AMI every day 4. Snapshot RDS instance every Monday AMIMOTO(https://amimoto-ami.com/) in this opportunity, we share the fruit of our knowledge we've gotten in these ten years. The topics are below. 1. What's AWS and what's good about that? 2. What is the easiest way to use the world's most modern infrastructure for your (clients') websites? 3. What is the best practice to get most out of WordPress and AWS combination? Tools to solve the problem of advanced WordPress developers and business One of the largest problem that WordPress developers face when their business grow is hosting. Hosting is the core for stability, scalability, and speed. Also, the workflow must be modern. We need to get backups automatically, deploy changes repeatedly, update WordPress and plugins smoothly, while the websites must be working under any circumstances. Our work with clients have given us a lot of experience, and we have created the tools to solve problems and to make our daily jobs easier. All of them are open sourced! We introduce these tools on this event. The tools we show you are below. # 1. AMIMOTO simple instance AMIMOTO is an EC2 web server you can boost with one click. It's pre-configured to offer WordPress users to start serving their websites with the best set-up of the middleware and WordPress. Nginx, PHP7, and proxy caching server and all the useful tools such as WP-CLI, and plugins that combine AWS and WordPress. # 2. JIN-KEI Cloudformation JIN-KEI is a formation of the AWS services, such as EC2, RDS (the database), S3(the assets storage), CloudFront(the CDN), and Elastic Load Balancing. Setup this formation with one click and start serving all the traffic you get.   # 3. Other tools Based on AMIMOTO and JIN-KEI, there are more tools which you can utilize to boost your business. • Elasticommerce: A robust expansion kit for WooCommerce, which enables you to operate your site at minimal infrastructure cost, even with varying access numbers depending on the seasons, events, and promotional campaigns. • Elasticommerce Search Form: A cloud-based elastic product search. This offloads the heavy searching process from your WordPress and web server to AWS. • Elasticommerce Related Items: This will learn what customers have purchased and searched for. Based on this learning, it recommends items users would be most interested in. • Mautic: An open source software, which helps you automate your marketing process and communicate with users. • Plugins to offload things from your WordPress to AWS: Search, rankings, related posts, and things like these are better to be offered outside of WordPress, especially the sites are large and high-traffic. AWS are good at doing these calculations, so we should get the results back from the services through APIs. We have open sourced plugins to connect WP and outer services. 5:00PM - 5:30PM Question &amp; Answer Session","location":"AWS Offices Singapore, 23 Church Street, Capital Square, #10-01, Singapore - 049481, +65-67220300","rsvp_count":85,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/AWS-SG/events/233057805/","group_id":13024512,"group_name":"AWS User Group Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/AWS-SG","formatted_time":"07 Sep 2016, Wed, 1:00 pm","start_time":"2016-09-07T05:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-09-07T10:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup"},{"id":"27118614506","name":"The Perfumer’s Palette -Science of Scent","description":"The Royal Society of Chemistry in partnership with the Nose Who Knows is excited to present The Perfumer’s Palette course to enhance participants’ knowledge on the ingredients used in perfumery and hone their sense of smell\n\nTopics covered will include:\nHow the sense of smell works; Memorization of an odor\nThe Perfumer’s Palette; Natural and Animalic raw materials; Synthetics raw materials\nExtraction methods; Reproduction and Head Space®\n\nNose Who Knows is a fragrance studio dedicated to olfaction owned by Sandy Blandin, a former fragrance development manager at Swiss company Firmenich with over 15 years experience in fragrance creation and education  \n","location":"National University of Singapore, Science Drive 2, S16, Level 3, Active Learning Room (ALR), Singapore  117546","url":"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-perfumers-palette-science-of-scent-tickets-27118614506?aff=ebapi","group_id":"7716239207","group_name":null,"group_url":"http://www.eventbrite.com/o/7716239207","formatted_time":"07 Sep 2016, Wed, 6:00 pm","start_time":"2016-09-07T10:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-09-07T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"232581113","name":"AWSUG-SG / JAWS Combined Meetup #1!","description":"With the upcoming WordCamp Singapore event on 6th September, many people from JAWS-UG (Japan AWS User Group) will be travelling to Singapore in September.

Spec - An Introduction (by Lucas Bradstreet) One of the gotchas with regards to Clojure and ClojureScript is the fact that they are dynamic languages and hence the absence of a type system. As most programmers come from more orthodox languages with large type systems this can cause problems. The authors of the language have recognised this and over the summer launched Spec which is a typical Clojurian take on type systems, infinitely customisable, extensible and brutally practical! Come and hear Lucas Bradstreet give an introduction to spec, how to start with it, ways to use it and not. It promises to be interesting.  Lucas Bradstreet who is a core developer on Onyx www.onyxplatform.org, an open source distributed batch and streaming platform built in, and for, Clojure. He works at Distributed Masonry, the stewards of the Onyx. Implement SPA with ClojureScript, Reagent/re-frame (by Hao Liu) This is an introduction to ClojureScript and a tutorial to implement a SPA (typerooni) with Reagent/re-frame, basic workflow to do the development.  Hao Liu is a Java veteran, but now with his full enthusiasm to FP, he has 2 years as a Colourist and is enthusiastic about the language. Discussion about the future of the group The long gap over the summer has highlighted several issues we as a group need to address. This is where we will do it.
