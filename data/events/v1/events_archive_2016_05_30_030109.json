Do join for the May meetup! Food and drinks are sponsored by Thoughtworks!  We will also be sharing exciting news about DevopsDays Singapore 2016 (check out last years conference here)! You won't want to miss it. The Talk:  DevOps and Continuous Delivery practices help increase deployment frequency of systems to production, while also increasing their reliability. A focus on automation makes it possible to deploy several times a day. However, operations teams might still resist when you try to apply these practices. In this talk I will present some principles and deployment practices that can help reduce the risk with frequent deployments and discuss how to increase collaboration between the development and operations teams.
