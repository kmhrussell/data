Scala, Angular 2, OAuth 2","description":"Hi,  We are organising another \"hands-on\" night. As usual, you will have 3 tracks to choose from (so you will be doing only one).  You will need to bring a laptop so you can do the labs. ScalaWe had lots of good feedback from Mark Brewer's talk on Scala last week. Based on that, we thought that some of you guys would want to try it out.  Damien Neveu from Redmart will do an introduction lab to Scala for Java developers. Securing a Spring/Angular JS application using OAuth 2Using OAuth 2 can be complex.  Tony Nguyen and Dapeng Liu (Pivotal) have prepared a simple workshop so you can get started with it and become comfortable with the basics. Angular 2Unless you've been living on another planet, you must have heard that Angular JS 2 has been released last week. This version is a complete rewrite of Angular JS 1. Germain Potet from Zenika will guide you through the creation of a simple application using Angular 2. We look forward to seeing you on Wednesday!","location":"PayPal office in Suntec, 5 Temasek Blvd, #09-01 Suntec Tower Five, 038985 Nearest Mrt:Promenade(Yellow Line), Singapore","rsvp_count":76,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/singasug/events/234315161/","group_id":13661682,"group_name":"Singapore Spring User Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/singasug","formatted_time":"28 Sep 2016, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-09-28T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-09-28T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.2945,"longitude":103.857964},{"id":"1803928766557393","name":"beer.py","description":"Who needs Homebrew when we have Mcgettigan's!!!","location":"Mcgettigan's Irish Pub, Clarke Quay - Singapore,  undefined","rsvp_count":20,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1803928766557393","group_id":"119975301418927","group_name":"Singapore Python User Group","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/119975301418927","formatted_time":"28 Sep 2016, Wed, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2016-09-28T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-09-28T14:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.2904266013043,"longitude":103.84509491348}]}
