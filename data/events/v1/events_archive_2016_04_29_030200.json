It's been awhile since our last meetup. We are planning to organise a series of meetup featuring various UX leaders in the industry to share about their UX journey.  To kick things off, this April we're happy to have David Travis from Userfocus who happens to be in Singapore to share his experience and insights with the UX community here.  About David Travis from the man himself:\"I'm a psychologist specialising in user experience. I help both large firms and start ups connect with their customers and bring business ideas to market. I play nicely with agile teams. I've authored 2 books and 3 online training courses on usability and user experience:   • User Experience: The Ultimate Guide to Usability: http://uxtraining.net  • Usability Testing Bootcamp: http://ude.my/clra2  How To Carry Out A Usability Expert Review: http://ude.my/clra0 --- Agenda7pm – 7.30pm: Registration and networking7.30pm – 8.30pm: Conversation with David Travis8.30pm: Networking and drinks :) We're hoping to keep the session really informal and casual where it is more conversational centric so bring along some of your burning questions in relation to user research, usability, psychology, user-centered design and more to the session. You can also tweet to us the questions you have to @IxDASG and we can have that answered.
