Practice rounds start at 3:10pm.  Qualifiers start at 4pm. Format: Qualifiers: 2.5 minute Most Laps, 5 Rounds, 1 Discard. Finals: Top three scores proceed to a head-to-head race, first past the post to win. For the qualifying rounds we will race three pilots at a time, with the next group of pilots as spotters for the previous group.  Pilots must say their name out loud each time they pass the start/finish gate so that their spotter will count their lap.  Spotters will observe correct navigation of the course and not count any incomplete laps. League points: 5 for 1st, 4 for 2nd, 3 for 3rd, 1 for competing. League score will consist of each pilot's top 5 scores out of 8 most recent events (so not being able to attend one or two events will not be a penalty) Novice fliers may compete following a simplified course, but there are no league points or finals for novice class. Course is designed for 250 sized FPV quads and smaller.  Maximum prop size is 6\" for safety reasons. As per usual, we'll be using 3 frequency slots:(Non raceband) 5725 or below, 5800, 5880 or above.(Race band) R1/2, R4/5, R7/8 \n\n\nFirst Place Prize: FuriousFPV Kombini - sponsored by furiousfpv.
