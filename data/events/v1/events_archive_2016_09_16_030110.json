Attendees will also become members of the UnaMakers programme for collaborating online with UnaBiz and our solution partners.\nAbout UnaBizUnaBiz is the exclusive operator of the SIGFOX IoT network in Singapore and Taiwan. We will deploy a nation-wide IoT network in Singapore to enable a Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) that is extremely low power, long range, cost effective and simple to use for compatible devices.This network will be an open and public network, giving equal access to qualified IoT channel partners, service providers, SMEs, large enterprises, government agencies and educational institutions. * Operates on the 920-922 MHz frequency range* Long range covering the whole of Singapore * Low device and subscription costs so that it can be deployed pervasively* Wireless and low power so that it can be installed and maintained easily on a very large scale* Doesn’t need pairing or SIM card so it can be connected easilyAbout UnaMakerUnaMaker is an online technical forum where UnaBiz Pte Ltd communicates with our solution partners. Its objectives are:• UnaBiz to share technology on SIGFOX network, devices, software, source code, and use cases with partners• Online technical and use cases discussion with Partners on IoT solution development\nSpeakers\nJonathan Tan, VP, Sales and Business Development, UnaBiz\nLee Lup Yuen, Principal Consultant, UnaBiz\n","location":"Crown Coffee, CT Hub 2, Level 1, 114 Lavender St, Singapore 338729","url":"http://www.eventbrite.sg/e/unacafe-introducing-the-sigfox-network-for-connecting-iot-devices-nationwide-tickets-27746627911?aff=ebapi","group_id":"11395347945","group_name":"UnaBiz","group_url":"http://www.eventbrite.sg/o/unabiz-11395347945","formatted_time":"16 Sep 2016, Fri, 2:30 pm","start_time":"2016-09-16T06:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-09-16T08:30:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"332435350432925","name":"Friday Hacks #118: Entity Component Systems in Elixir & Docker","description":"This week we have Yos from PayPal and Yong Wen from IDA talking about some of the things they work on. See you there!\r\n\r\nDate/Time: Friday, September 16 at 6:30pm \r\nVenue: The Hangar by NUS Enterprise \r\nFree pizza is served before the talks. \r\n\r\nTalk 1\r\n\r\nEntity Component Systems in Elixir\r\n\r\nEntity-Component-System (ECS) is a distributed and compositional architectural design pattern that is mostly used in game development. Elixir is a dynamic, functional language built on top of the Erlang VM designed for building scalable and maintainable applications. In this talk, discover how we can use both ECS and Elixir in a novel approach to structure our programs beyond the traditional OO/inheritance paradigm. We’ll cover:\r\n\r\nWhat are Entity Component Systems? \r\n(Brief) Introduction to Elixir \r\nECS in Elixir \r\nQ&A\r\n\r\nSpeaker Profile\r\n\r\nYos is a recent Computer Science graduate from NUS SoC, currently working as a software engineer at PayPal. In his spare time, Yos moonlights as an Elixir neophyte and enjoys learning new things.\r\n\r\nTalk 2\r\n\r\nDeploying with Docker\r\n\r\nTalk Description:\r\n\r\nDocker is now a stable and widely used container technology used to deploy applications on the internet. In this talk, we will take a quick look at some of the Linux Kernel technology that powers Docker, and some of the issues with Docker like how needlessly complicated it is to deploy a simple Ruby on Rails Application with a Let’s Encrypt TLS certificate.\r\n\r\nSpeaker Profile\r\n\r\nYong Wen is a software developer and kopi aficionado working at Government Digital Services of GovTech. He likes to meddle in DevOps related work once in a while, and is an avid gamer.\r\n\r\nOur Sponsors\r\n\r\nFriday Hacks is sponsored by the NUS Enterprise Center.","location":"The Hangar by NUS Enterprise, , Singapore","rsvp_count":6,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/332435350432925","group_id":"164904410234667","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/164904410234667","formatted_time":"16 Sep 2016, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-09-16T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-09-16T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook"},{"id":"1643900335902020","name":"TGIFHacks #53 - Entrepreneurial Journey (Xfers)","description":"On this Friday, Liu Tianwei will share his own entrepreneurial journey from working as a Software Engineer at Amazon to becoming a CEO of Xfers, a Y-Combinator alumni and payment gateway solution that automates manual verification of bank transfers.
