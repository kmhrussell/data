This talk will cover details about how it can be used as a powerful and versatile platform for big data.  Talk 2: Apache Apex is a native Hadoop data-in-motion platform. We will discuss architectural differences between Apache Apex features with Spark Streaming. We will discuss how these differences effect use cases like ingestion, fast real-time analytics, data movement, ETL, fast batch, very low latency SLA, high throughput and large scale ingestion.   We will cover fault tolerance, low latency, connectors to sources/destinations, smart partitioning, processing guarantees, computation and scheduling model, state management and dynamic changes. We will also discuss how these features affect time to market and total cost of ownership.

Apache Apex Data Ingestion is a standalone big data application that simplifies the collection, aggregation and movement of large amounts of data to and from Hadoop for a more efficient data processing pipeline. Apache Apex Data Ingestion makes configuring and running Hadoop data ingestion and data extraction a point and click process enabling a smooth, easy path to your Hadoop-based big data project. In this series of talks, we would cover how Hadoop Ingestion is made easy using Apache Apex. The first talk in this series would focus on ingesting unbounded file data. We will also give a brief overview of the Apex platform at the beginning of the session. Please register for the webinar at: https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8508384190355730436 After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the webinar. Apache Apex is a next generation native Hadoop data in motion platform that is being used by customers for both streaming as well as batch processing. Common use cases include ingestion into Hadoop, streaming analytics, ETL, database off-loads, alerts and monitoring, machine model scoring, etc. Apache Apex completely separates operational logic from business logic, and handles all operational aspects. This enables developers to concentrate on business logic and reduce time to market as well as total cost of ownership.  For deeper engagement with Apache Apex - follow ApacheApex, presentations, recordings, download (community, sandbox), Apache Apex releases, docs  This webcast is of an Apache Apex meetup event done earlier in Pune, IN and we are webcasting it enable other BigFoots to participate. If you are interested in helping organize (hosting, presenting, community leadership) Apache Apex (next gen Hadoop) community, please email &lt;a&gt;[masked]&lt;/a&gt; ","location":"Webcast, Online, Singapore","rsvp_count":14,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Apache-Apex-Singapore/events/232476495/","group_id":20147631,"group_name":"Apache Apex Next Gen Native Hadoop Big Data, Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Apache-Apex-Singapore","formatted_time":"12 Jul 2016, Tue, 10:30 pm","start_time":"2016-07-12T14:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-07-12T15:45:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.355379,"longitude":103.867744}]}
