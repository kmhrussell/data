Jenkins 2.0 will address the demands of teams challenged with matching the pace of continuous software delivery while ensuring quality and providing visibility across the full delivery process. Updates to core Jenkins capabilities include delivery pipeline support, clear visibility of development stages and enhancements to help users get started more quickly. This session will provide a quick summary of some of the topics covered in the recent Jenkins Online Meetup. - Pipeline as Code Overview- New UX Changes in 2.0- Documentation- The road beyond 2.0 ---------- Topic: Implementing an Application Security Pipeline in Jenkins Abstract : Performing continuous security testing in a DevOps environment with short release cycles and a continuous delivery pipeline is a big challenge and the traditional secure SDLC model fails to deliver the desired results. DevOps understand the process of built, test and deploy. They have largely automated this process in a delivery pipeline, they deploy to production multiple times per day but the big challenge is how can they do this securely? This session will focus on a strategy to build an application security pipeline in Jenkins, challenges and possible solutions, also how existing application security solutions (SAST, DAST, IAST, OpenSource Libraries Analysis) are playing a key role in growing the relationship between security and DevOps. Speakers Bio : Suman has almost a decade experience in designing software security defense programs and is passionate about integrating security into the development life-cycle. At Autodesk he is working on designing solutions for continuous security testing and built-in security into SDLC.","location":"IDA@Sandcrawler, 1 Fusionopolis View, #08-01, Singapore 138577","rsvp_count":46,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Jenkins-User-Group-Singapore/events/231393648/","group_id":19623244,"group_name":"Jenkins User Group Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Jenkins-User-Group-Singapore","formatted_time":"06 Jun 2016, Mon, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-06-06T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-06-06T12:30:00.000Z","latitude":1.298975,"longitude":103.788811}]}
