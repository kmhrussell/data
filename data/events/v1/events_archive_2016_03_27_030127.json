This is just to advertise the FutureMe drone race happening in Marina Bay on 27th March. Registration is already closed, but come and support your hobby and encourage those that are competing! Introduce your friends to your cool hobby! Lots of entertainment for everyone! I'll be competing - as will a couple of others members, so do come and support us!!! Looking forward to a great 2016, there are many moves afoot to make drone racing a permanent fixture on the Singaporean calendars! I'll make sure the good ones are shared through meetup.com!","location":"Marina Bay Floating Platform, Raffles Avenue, Singapore","rsvp_count":20,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/dronesg/events/229536602/","group_id":18318692,"group_name":"Singapore FPV Fun Meetup (Drone Fun)","group_url":"http://meetup.com/dronesg","formatted_time":"27 Mar 2016, Sun, 9:00 am","start_time":"2016-03-27T01:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-03-27T08:00:00.000Z","latitude":1.290316,"longitude":103.859466}]}
