Devices like sensors and industrial equipment often are set up to operate for years in isolation with no service visits. Nearly 1.5 million devices will be connected to these so-called LPWA (low-power wide-area) networks by 2020, according to Machina Research.  NB-IoT will provide for better indoor coverage, low latency, low device cost and a massive number of connected devices In this talk we will discuss how NB-IoT opens up opportunities for number of use cases and applications not possible before.  \n\n\nBenjamin has worked as a research engineer in Panasonic for more than a decade.

Topic 2:  SQL Server Query Store - The Real \"Deal\" Synopsis:  \"Why my database performance has been suddenly slow?  Have my query plans changed?  Which plans have regressed and since when?  Is there any way I can control the plan change without changing the source code?\" If you have encountered any of the above situations, then query store is your remedy. SQL Server Query store is one of the path breaking features released in SQL Server 2016. The presentation will showcase how query store is a boon in handling sudden performance degradations, plan changes and analyzing query performance patterns over a period of time.
