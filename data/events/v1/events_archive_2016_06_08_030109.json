If you're interesting in giving a talk to the BTC community in SG, sharing your idea &amp; startup, getting beta users, etc., let me know. We're looking to have a few meetups with awesome speakers &amp; thought leaders starting the night's conversation. -------- Side note: Sarnie's cafe accepts Bitcoin, and they're really being cool by giving us so much of their space at peak hours to have our meetup there. So, it's cool and supportive if you order from their menu (for bitcoin, of course). They also happen to make shockingly delicious food (I highly recommend the Chicken In A Paper Bag), and damn good coffee (their own custom house blend).","location":"Sarnies, 136 Telok Ayer , Singapore","rsvp_count":20,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/BitcoinSingapore/events/230426245/","group_id":8103652,"group_name":"Bitcoins in Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/BitcoinSingapore","formatted_time":"08 Jun 2016, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-06-08T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-06-08T13:00:00.000Z","latitude":1.28166,"longitude":103.8479},{"id":"1776845012343350","name":"Microspace Nanosatellites, aiming at targets far, far away","description":"Join us for an exciting tech talk with Dr Giulio Manzoni, founder of Microspace Rapid Pte Ltd, the first and only Singapore small medium enterprise to concieve and develop nanosatellites.

We will meet at 7PM as usual and will mingle/ have pizzas until 7.30PM. We will then have 2 talks. Level of Spring: low (*) Food sponsor for this event: Pivotal First Talk: Solving Developer pains with Docker! (Srikanth Nutigattu and Germain Potet) With the advent of different libraries, tools and environments it is becoming challenging to maintain a sane development environment, due to version conflicts, local path overwrites, polluting global space.   Working on different projects or switching between projects is becoming difficult. Onboarding new developers take time due to their dev machine setup. Srikanth and Germain will show you how Docker can solve the developer side problems, in addition to solving the deployment side! \n\n\nSecond Talk: Data modeling (Eric Vergnaud) We have interviewed Eric here.Data modeling can be a challenging activity when spanning across relational, object and functional models.In his talk, Eric walks us through the issues. He will then explain the benefits of a new data modeling paradigm based on attributes reification. He will show technologies which already use it, and he will unveil an experimental programming language called Prompto, built for purpose. He will finally provide guidance on how to improve data modeling in Java and SQL. \n\n\n(*) Note about our \"Level of Spring\" rating: our Singapore Spring User Group is the best place for Java/Spring developers to meet and discuss topics that are relevant to their everyday programing life. Some of our talks are not directly related to Spring.","location":"PayPal office in Suntec, 5 Temasek Blvd, #09-01 Suntec Tower Five, 038985 Nearest Mrt:Promenade(Yellow Line), Singapore","rsvp_count":120,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/singasug/events/231332765/","group_id":13661682,"group_name":"Singapore Spring User Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/singasug","formatted_time":"08 Jun 2016, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-06-08T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-06-08T13:00:00.000Z","latitude":1.2945,"longitude":103.857964},{"id":"230920405","name":"June Meetup: The Tried & Tested","description":"Hello fellow Djangonauts! Last meetup was awesome, so let's do it again! We had identified lots of topics for potential future talks and presentations but the one topic that almost no one had touched yet was Test Driven Development with Django. This is not acceptable. We need to fix that :) --------------------------------- Agenda: 7pm: Welcome and mingle, enjoy some Pizza 7:30pm: Talk: The Django Test Driven Development Cookbook by Martin Brochhaus Martin is currently working as the CTO of theartling.com and luxglove.com and is maintaining a codebase with ~30k lines of code and ~12k lines of tests. In this 45 minutes talk, he will show how you can setup your first Django test-suite with py.test, how you can create fixtures with mixer and how you can measure test coverage. He will also show common patterns and snippets that will help you overtake the initial hurdles of getting in to testing: How to speed up tests? How to mock third party libraries? How to test forms and class based views with Django's RequestFactory? How to test admin functions and management commands? How to test Django Rest Framework's API views and serializers?  8:30pm.
