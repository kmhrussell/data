Thanks for your support!  \nInstructables is coming back to Singapore and we are excited to see what the community here has been busy with. Come present your latest, greatest creations or feel free to take a look.  \nIt will be an exciting gathering of like-minded people to share their ideas, current and future projects. Feel free to share this invite with anyone who may be interested or have a hidden gem of a project that they’re dying to show. Eric Wilhelm, the founder of Instructables, will be present to give his input and approval to the projects shown! \nWe will also be sharing some  upcoming Autodesk projects that are happening in Singapore. Light refreshments will be served after the event (9pm) so feel free to hang around and meet one another!  \nWe are also holding a presentation and panel discussion event on June 4th 2016, 2pm – 5pm at The Projector on the Future of Making in Singapore, details can be found here.  ","location":"Autodesk Asia, 3 Fusionopolis Way, #10-21 Symbiosis, Singapore 138633","url":"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/instructables-show-tell-in-sunny-singapore-tickets-25189842497?aff=ebapi","group_id":"10748732098","group_name":"Autodesk Pier 9","group_url":"http://www.eventbrite.com/o/autodesk-pier-9-10748732098","formatted_time":"07 Jun 2016, Tue, 6:00 pm","start_time":"2016-06-07T10:00:00Z","end_time":"2016-06-07T13:00:00Z"},{"id":"231463742","name":"AXA x DSSG (Fraud Detection & Telematics)","description":"Hi all,  NOTE: Please refer to the new attendance policy before RSVP to this meetup. RSVP will only open on 31st May, Tuesday (12pm) and closes on 5th June (12pm).  For our June meetup, we're excited to have Tarik and Nathaniel from AXA's Global Data Innovation Lab share about fraud detection, and telematics and connected cars! 6.45pm-7.15pm: Networking session [casual; small talk]  7.15pm-7.45pm: Tarik Dadi: Tarik will share with you the different approaches that have been explored to provide the business clients of the DIL with technics allowing to make the models not only accurate but also interpretable to human experts. The ability to explain how a specific prediction has been made by a classifier is important since it allows human experts to act more efficiently on the result of the prediction. [casual; industry applications of data science]  7.45pm - 8.15pm: Nathaniel Bern: Nathaniel Bern will be talking first about the missions of the AXA Data Innovation Lab, and will then deep dive into some interesting Data Science topics tackled in the telematics team: from supervised learning with risk prediction and road dangerosity to different methods of clustering for trip inference and driving profile understanding. [casual; industry applications of data science] [] : Suggested rating and topic; ranges from: newbie - casual - core - hardcore. Speaker Bio: Tarik Dadi graduated with a dual Engineering degree in Computational Mathematics from EISTI and Agro ParisTech. At the same time, he studied Statistics and Artificial Intelligence during a Master’s degree at Paris-Dauphine University. He joined the AXA Data Innovation Lab in April 2015 to work on Lambda Architecture and Online Learning, he currently works on fraud detection technics for the automobile insurance. Nathaniel Bern holds a Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from the Ecole Polytechnique, France. He studied Statistical Learning and Applied Machine Learning during a dual Master’s degree, at the ENSAE ParisTech and the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan, where he worked for instance on NLP and Reinforcement Learning projects. He has been working as a Data Scientist at AXA Data Innovation Lab since May 2015, working on a telematics insurance product.","location":"#03-04, IDA Labs@NDC 111 Middle Road, National Design Centre, Singapore 188969., IDA Labs@NDC 111 Middle Road, National Design Centre","rsvp_count":148,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/DataScience-SG-Singapore/events/231463742/","group_id":11168062,"group_name":"DataScience SG","group_url":"http://meetup.com/DataScience-SG-Singapore","formatted_time":"07 Jun 2016, Tue, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-06-07T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-06-07T12:30:00.000Z","latitude":1.29891,"longitude":103.85319},{"id":"ztkqtlyvjbkb","name":"Book Club: From NAND to Tetris – Computer Architecture","description":"Read The Elements of of Computing Systems and/or follow the Coursera course Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris.   This week we'll be covering the chapter on Computer Architecture.  \n\n\n\"I did the coursework because understanding computers is important to me, just like literacy and numeracy, and I made it through. I never worked harder on anything, never been challenged to this degree. But given what I now feel capable of doing, I would certainly do it again. To anyone considering NAND2Tetris, it's a tough journey, but you'll be profoundly changed.\" Shimon Schocken, the author of the book talks about the course at TED: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE7YRHxwoDs How Book Club Works1. Read the chapter before you come to the meetup.2. Find something in the chapter you found interesting and maybe research it a little more.3. At the meetup, we go around the room and each person gets a chance to tell the group about the thing they found interesting.4. Group discussion and banter ensues!
