On, Saturday, April 16, 2016 we are out to set some records again! The story about #GlobalAzure is as unique as it is grand. Each year hundreds of organizers around the globe arrange Azure user group events on the same day.  April of 2013 we held the first Global Windows Azure Bootcamp at more than 90 locations around the globe. In March 2014 we topped that with 136 locations, and then again last year in 2015 we hit 182 locations! This year we are again doing a one day deep dive class to help thousands of people get up to speed on developing Cloud Computing Applications for Azure.  Agenda... (http://singapore.azurebootcamp.net/)  Lucky Draw Prizes...  - Parallels Desktop for Mac - Aspose.Total Product Family - Redgate SQL Source Control and more surprise take-aways..

Racing will likely be in a round-robin format so you'll have multiple heats.  If we get more than 3 heats per racer, then we'll run a 'discard' rule that drops your lowest position, and proceed with the top three results into a final race.  Roughly following sailing fleet racing scoring practices. 5:30 onwards - free fly and packing up.  Help with collecting cones &amp; flags etc.. is always gratefully received :) Race Frequencies • 5725 or below • 5800 or Raceband 5 • 5880 or above Each race will use the above three frequency allocations, where a range is specified you may use any available frequency available in that range, except for 5645 and 5945.  Don't forget to alter both your Tx and Rx.  When your Tx must be powered on to change frequency - wait until your heat is being setup and change your frequency while your competitors are getting ready.  Once your quad is ready and your frequency is set, please indicate that to the organiser and your fellow competitors.  Once all three competitors are ready we will double check the video feed before going into the launch sequence. \n\n\nLook forward to seeing you all tomorrow, get those lipos charged!","location":"Behind Outram Park MRT, 1A Pearl Bank, Singapore","rsvp_count":24,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/dronesg/events/229536675/","group_id":18318692,"group_name":"Singapore FPV Fun Meetup (Drone Fun)","group_url":"http://meetup.com/dronesg","formatted_time":"16 Apr 2016, Sat, 2:30 pm","start_time":"2016-04-16T06:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-04-16T10:30:00.000Z","latitude":1.282631,"longitude":103.839241}]}
