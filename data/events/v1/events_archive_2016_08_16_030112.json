In this talk, we will share the architecture, programming model and examples of V1.0, which improves the usability and efficiency over V0.3. In particular, users can write C++ and Python code to train deep learning models. With the support of OpenCL, SINGA is able to run on Nvidia GPU and other hardware devices (e.g., AMD GPU and FPGA). Optimisations in terms of speed and memory management would also be discussed. Speaker: Wei Wang is completing his Ph.D. in School of Computing, National University of Singapore. His research interests including deep learning systems and multi-modal data analysis. He is a committer of the SINGA project. http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~wangwei/. • 8:00pm - 8:45pm Presentation: High Performance Machine Learning Models ­ A Practical Guide to Statistical Efficiency Synopsis: Are you developing machine learning models for tasks such as medical diagnosis, algorithmic trading, or any other domain where accuracy and precision is critical? Have you already tried model ensembles / cross validation and other textbook methods, but still need to squeeze out more performance (in terms of accuracy) from your models? Do you work in a domain where data is hard to come by? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you need to figure out how to increase the statistical efficiency of your models. Statistical efficiency is a measure of model optimality ­ a more efficient model will need fewer observations than a less efficient model to achieve a given performance. This talk will present techniques to increase the statistical efficiency. These techniques are practical, battle­hardened and go beyond what is commonly found in typical textbooks. Speaker: Shankar Satish is a Data Scientist at Manulife, where he builds machine learning and AI tools, platforms and teams for the firm’s insurance and asset management arms. He has a background in building data science and machine learning / AI systems for a variety of domains, including self driving / autonomous drones, IoT and e­commerce. • 8:45pm - 8:50pm Lucky draw sponsored by O'Reilly Updates • New ebooks/videos from O'Reilly!

Whilst historically, there have been disproportionate investments in network security, the current era of social, mobile, cloud, IoT and increasingly reliable biometrics is beginning to bring DevOps (indicative of the need for agility), Hybrid IT and Automation to the center stage. Viren in his talk will focus on the requirements for integrating security across the DevOps pipeline, focusing on traceability and management of risks across business units. The emphasis is on agility and automation while recognizing the growing acceptance of the cloud and thus the emergence of Hybrid IT, requiring a larger focus on customer confidentiality, data security, privacy and intellectual property. Viren also provides his views on how matured security teams break down silos and enjoy increased synergy and collaboration across all lines of business. Implementing Docker Load Balancing in Microservices Infrastructure DevOps is changing the development model; previously, applications were deployed as a whole in a complex and months-long process of development, testing and roll-out that thoroughly consumed IT resources. The microservices architecture enables an agile application delivery method where individual components can be deployed to add functionality to an application in use without disrupting the rest of the application’s processes. This session will explain how to provide Docker load balancing with full Layer 4 to 7 capabilities from content switching to SSL/TLS offload and DDoS protection. The solution that can adapt to dynamic changes in microservices infrastructure, supports flexible deployment modes to meet networking and security requirements. Speakers Bio :  Viren Mantri is a senior IT executive with more than 15 years of experience in developing strategies for protection against cyber attack threats and managing large transformation programs. With a niche expertise in information security, risk, audit and applications development, he has led diverse teams at Citibank, KPMG, McAfee, UBS and Standard Chartered Bank whilst also running his own consulting company in between. Viren has a Bachelor of Science from the University of Mumbai and a Master of Technology degree in Knowledge Engineering from the National University of Singapore (NUS).

This Week: Algorithmic Challenges (Week 3) * Finish Assignment 2: Burrows-Wheeler Transform and Suffix Arrays Description World and internet is full of textual information. We search for information using textual queries, we read websites, books, e-mails. All those are strings from the point of view of computer science. To make sense of all that information and make search efficient, search engines use many string algorithms. Moreover, the emerging field of personalized medicine uses many search algorithms to find disease-causing mutations in the human genome. See https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-strings for more info on this course. Coursera offers a free \"auditor\" option and a paid option, if you want a certificate at the end. How to Participate 1. Watch the lectures and start the week's assignments.2. Find something in the week's content you found interesting and maybe research it a little more.3. At the meetup, we go around the room and each person gets a chance to tell the group about the thing they found interesting or ask questions.4. Group discussion and friendly banter ensues!
