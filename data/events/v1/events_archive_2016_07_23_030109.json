If you rsvp, please bring your laptop on the day to take part; attendance will not be taken without a laptop. RSVP will only open on 18th July, Monday (12pm) and closes on 22th July (12pm).  For our July meetup, we're excited to have Martin Andrews share about deep learning! Deep Learning is a hot topic, but has a steep initial learning curve. There will be code. Lots of code. To ease the pain, a pre-configured virtual machine will be handed out, so that participants can run it on their own laptops using cross-platform open-source VirtualBox. Bring a laptop with VirtualBox installed! The workshop will start from the very basics (with a little mathematics), and quickly progress to getting hands-on with open source software including the training of a deep network on simple problems. This will be followed by a more in-depth portion : Using a pre-built Virtual Machine, run within VirtualBox, participants will experiment with a much larger pre-trained models, and get an understanding of two application areas relevant to datascientists (expected to be : image classification and anamoly detection). While parts of this are very technical, the models (inside the Virtual Machine) are all in Jupyter (fka iPython) notebooks, making interaction straightforward. However, participants should install VirtualBox on their laptops beforehand, or expect to be mocked... 9.30am - 10.00am: Networking [casual] 10.00am - 11.00am: Sharing on the basics of deep learning and the math behind it [core] 11.00am - 11.15am: Break 11.15am - 12.30pm: Hands-on, including training of a deep network for simple problems [hardcore] [] : Suggested rating and topic; ranges from:newbie - casual - core - hardcore.","location":"SMU School of Economics and Social Science, Seminar Room 5.2 (lift access only), 90 Stamford Road, Singapore","rsvp_count":77,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/DataScience-SG-Singapore/events/232577187/","group_id":11168062,"group_name":"DataScience SG","group_url":"http://meetup.com/DataScience-SG-Singapore","formatted_time":"23 Jul 2016, Sat, 10:00 am","start_time":"2016-07-23T02:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-07-23T05:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.29802,"longitude":103.848953},{"id":"26633517568","name":"Singapore Science Festival: Visual SG: Beauty in Patterns","description":"South East Asia’s signature Visualisation Festival, Visual SG, presents a full on visual spectacle of data through the lens of artistic and creative expression.
