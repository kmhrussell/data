The Drupal Association partners with companies and local community groups around the world to host these introductory Drupal trainings.  Each training day is its own workshop. As an attendee, you get helpful information for evaluating Drupal as a framework and as a career path. You also learn enough of the basics to leave a workshop having successfully built a Drupal site. We've not decided whether to cover Drupal 7 or Drupal 8 in this session so leave a comment below to tell us :) Limited seats available! This training session is organised by Pixel Onion. What to bring for the session: • Laptop with power adapter, mac or windows is fine • Water bottle, in case you get thirsty during the session, there are water cooler provided • Writing materials • An open mind :) Lunch is not provided for the session but there's a food court downstairs with plenty of food choices.

For this milestone we have got a really cool workshop for you guys! We are gonna have a Yii Framework workshop, a framework that helps build MVC web applications in PHP. We will be teaching on how to build a shopping cart from scratch! \n\nDo you find using frameworks daunting? (be it in PHP, DJango or Python?)\nHead down to the workshop to understand the fundamental concepts frameworks are built upon! \n\nThis workshop is generally for people who wants to build websites. The contents covered are the fundamentals of web development on principles that allows for future code extension and debugging purposes through MVC Architecture. This workshop brings the understanding of the MVC Architecture through the development of a shopping cart. The takeaway for my talk is to enhance knowledge on the frameworks available out there and the fundamentals of MVC Architecture.\n\n6.30pm - Overview of MVC Architecture\n6.40pm - Basics building blocks of shopping cart\n6.50pm - Why PHP & Yii Architecture?\n7.00pm - Intro & Demo of building Models\n7.30pm - Intro & Demo of building Controllers\n8.00pm - Intro & Demo of building Views\n8.15pm - Showcase of Shopping Cart\n8.20pm - Summary of MVC Architecture and Projects created\n\nJoin us!

Join us for this programming languages themed talk.\n\nPizzas served before the talks.\n\n-------\n\nImplementing a toy compiler with LLVM\n\nTalk Description:\n\nLLVM is a compiler infrastructure project, designed as a set of reusable libraries. From humble beginnings as a research project, it has recently gained much traction, thanks to Apple adopting it as their default compiler toolchain for iOS and Mac OS platforms. \n\nAt it's core, LLVM features an architecture independent, type safe, instruction set called \"LLVM IR\", which LLVM compiles to several instruction sets including x86/x86-64, ARM, Power PC etc. So in essence, if you're lazy and want to implement a multi platform programming language that runs \"natively\", LLVM saves you tons of time and effort.\n\nThis talk will go through implementing a very very simple compiler for a very very simple, toy programming language, using LLVM.\n\nSpeaker Profile\n\nOmer is an NUS Hackers alumnus, currently working as an iOS Software Engineer at Garena. He also moonlights as a Functional Programming Evangelical, and is a little obsessed with writing useless, toy compilers. \n\n--------\n\nSlaying the Dragon: Implementing a language in Ruby\n\nTalk Description:\n\nLearning to write a programming language is considered a rite of passage for some programmers. And, it is also the most rewarding exercise as you will learn a whole lot about programming languages in general. Many might think it's a daunting task but Jason will show you otherwise by showing how to implement a simple language in Ruby and compile it to Rubinius bytecode. Be warned, only the brave and true will survive. Don't you worry though, no prior knowledge of parsing, lexing and programming language theory required. And lastly, don't forget to have fun.\n\nSpeaker Profile\n\nJason Yeo flips bits and blows stacks at SourceClear (www.srcclr.com). Some of his interests include participating in pointless discussions about type systems, writing interpreters for languages that has no real world application, bashing languages that has real world applications and embedding easter eggs in talk descriptions.\n\nMore information here: http://nushackers.org/2016/04/friday-hacks-112-Apr-8\n\nOur Sponsors\n\nFriday Hacks is sponsored by the NUS Enterprise Center.\n\nIf you are looking to turn your ideas into a startup and would love some business support, feel free to get in touch with Agustiadi from NUS Enterprise: agustiadi@nus.edu.sg","location":"Seminar Room 3, Town Plaza, UTown, NUS","rsvp_count":22,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/213455062355930","group_id":"164904410234667","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/164904410234667","formatted_time":"08 Apr 2016, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-04-08T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-04-08T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"bblsmlyvgblb","name":"UX TL;DR is a learning event where everyone participates!","description":"Have you ever come across something new in UX, had the browser tab open for weeks, but never found time to research it?
