An example of using k8s as a distributed systems framework  9) Introduction to Hasura  Each point will use a live-demo (or a recorded session as backup) and will then have 2-3 backing slides on salient points. This will NOT be a theory talk. It will be a demo-driven talk. \n\n\nAbout the speaker:  Tanmai is a Bachelors &amp; Masters graduate in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. Although originally specialising in Computer Vision, Tanmai has gradually moved his area of expertise to Software Engineering, DevOps &amp; functional/reactive programming in the cloud/web application space. He has spearheaded 'immutable infrastructure' &amp; functional programming efforts (both server/client side) at Hasura &amp; 34 Cross. He is currently CTO at Hasura. \n\n\n\nAbout Hasura: Hasura is a platform for building scalable application backends, while retaining complete control. With out of the box APIs for database, search, authentication, etc., Hasura minimises the time taken to build your application backend. It is built on top of Kubernetes, Docker, CoreOS and is designed to be run anywhere; from a dev machine to a bare metal environment; a single node to a cluster; our most recent instant deployment was on a VMWare cluster for a payment wallet startup in India.  This PaaS + BaaS solution arose out of the very real need of having to build applications rapidly and then having to maintain them (like Django &amp; RoR). Hasura puts together all the best platform components along with the best application components like PostgresQL, Redis, Nginx and glues everything together to create a seamless, yet open experience for the developer.","location":"Thoughtworks, 87B Amoy Street #04, Singapore 069906, Singapore","rsvp_count":60,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/devops-singapore/events/231877973/","group_id":3202252,"group_name":"DevOps Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/devops-singapore","formatted_time":"22 Jun 2016, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-06-22T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-06-22T13:00:00.000Z","latitude":1.28094,"longitude":103.847076},{"id":"1170311836346805","name":"All About 3D Printing","description":"3D Printing is synonymous with modern cutting edge technology of the 21st century.
