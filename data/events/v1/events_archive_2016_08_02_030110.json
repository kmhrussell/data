We search for information using textual queries, we read websites, books, e-mails. All those are strings from the point of view of computer science. To make sense of all that information and make search efficient, search engines use many string algorithms. Moreover, the emerging field of personalized medicine uses many search algorithms to find disease-causing mutations in the human genome. See https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-strings for more info on this course. Coursera offers a free \"auditor\" option and a paid option, if you want a certificate at the end.
