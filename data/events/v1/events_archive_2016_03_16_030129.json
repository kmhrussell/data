There are absolutely no fees. Just come with an open mind and willingness to share and learn Agenda :  Introduction &amp; Networking  security for a connected world  by Chadi Hantouche, Solucom Abstract: Connected devices are invading our everyday life, and this trend is going to grow over the coming years. On a corporate level, the Internet of Things is also increasingly praised by employees, and integrated into business processes. Through business projects, we were able to identify the 4 security dimensions of the IoT. We developed a risk assessment methodology that is specific to this domain, named “CARA”: Conceive, Acquire, Recommend, Accommodate. This presentation will allow us to put forward an overview of these risks (with examples of real-life attacks), and offer a dedicated risk assessment approach that can be applied in business settings. Bio: Chadi is a risk management &amp; cybersecurity senior manager at Solucom, a global advisory company now opening an office in Singapore. For over 10 years, he has helped companies assessing their risk and maturity level, and define associated solutions. He has a focus on security to support innovative technologies (Big Data, Internet of Things, Cloud computing, Mobility) as well as prevention and reaction against cyberattacks. Chadi is a CISSP, ISO 27001 LI and ITIL certified professional. He is a regular speaker on French and international TV channels and newspapers, security associations chapters and summits, and lecturer in several computer science universities.","location":"Thought Works,  Level 3, 87B Amoy Street, 069906, Singapore","rsvp_count":44,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Null-Singapore-The-Open-Security-Community/events/229593314/","group_id":18493025,"group_name":"Null Singapore - The Open Security Community","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Null-Singapore-The-Open-Security-Community","formatted_time":"16 Mar 2016, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-03-16T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-03-16T13:00:00.000Z","latitude":1.28101,"longitude":103.84697},{"id":"195869754115004","name":"Lesser-known China, and solving healthcare problems with open technology.

It is an extensive account of China as a nation with many cultures and sub cultures, quite like India. The comparison is striking and makes the reader notice likeness and un-likeness both, as easily as one would expect a walkthrough, that an experiential book should make possible.\n\n--\n\nThe value of open source healthcare IT solutions\nMayank Sharma\n\nThe talk will be focused on the value of open source healthcare IT solutions and specifically how OpenMRS tries to solve healthcare sector related problems using open source technologies. Mayank will also talk about how people can get involved and begin contributing to the project.\n\nOpenMRS Inc is the largest java based open source medical record system that is widely used in Kenya, Rwanda, Haiti, Mozambique, India and at many more locations under resource constrained settings.","location":"HackerspaceSG","rsvp_count":16,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/195869754115004","group_name":"HackerspaceSG Awesome Talks","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/1478420759137175","formatted_time":"16 Mar 2016, Wed, 8:00 pm","start_time":"2016-03-16T12:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-03-16T14:00:00.000Z"}]}
