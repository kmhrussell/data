You don't want to miss this one! \n\n\nTHEME: IMPACT MAPPING WITH INNOVATION GAMES Impact Mapping is a lightweight method for strategic planning in product and project development.

Sustainable Living Lab and (these)abilities will be examining the trends affecting what motivates volunteers, experimenting with different messages to engage them and exploring how cutting edge technologies can help create strong volunteer relationships. Whether you are a volunteer, a volunteer manager or simply curious, you can’t miss this! At the end of this series, we hope that you will understand and be inspired by the principles behind inclusive design. We also hope that whether you are a volunteer or a volunteer manager you will walk away with a toolkit that will help you to manage volunteer relationships better.\n\nIn this first session, we will be getting to understand the challenges that (these)abilities faces -- how might we as able-bodied persons understand the challenges in creating inclusive design? What motivates or frustrates someone to work in this space? Do we know if we are respectful of our fellow volunteers' gifts and talents? \n\nCome join us this Friday with your curiosity and find out! \n\n== \nPlease note the location -- we will be meeting at the Community Lab at UWCSEA Tampines. Please write in to chewlin.kay@sl2square.org to register -- we will be writing to registered participants on Thursday with directions.","location":"Sustainable Living Lab (SL2), 1 Tampines Street 73, Singapore 528704","rsvp_count":2,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1781457182097596","group_id":"172727739480818","group_name":"Sustainable Living Lab (SL2)","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/172727739480818","formatted_time":"07 Oct 2016, Fri, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2016-10-07T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-10-07T14:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.29891,"longitude":103.85319}]}
