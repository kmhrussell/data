Abstract:   Project: wrapt Python is a dynamic programming language and has a strong tradition of adhering to a programming style called duck-typing. This means that it is possible to easily modify an application's code while it is running. One might wish to do this for various reasons, including enhancing the functionality of code, correcting errant behaviour, or adding instrumentation or debugging code. Making such code modifications can be tricky though and not done correctly can potentially interfere with the operation of the original code, through destroying introspection abilities, not honouring the duck-typing mantra or due to being applied at the wrong time. If you do need to do monkey patching though, the 'wrapt' library is your friend, with its transparent object proxy wrappers and post import hook mechanism, it allows you to safely monkey patch code to modify its behaviour. Come learn about the 'wrapt' library and the joys, but also the dangers, of monkey patching.

This Week: Minimum Spanning Trees (Week 5) * Watch Minimum Spanning Trees Lectures (~40 min)* Finish Assignment 4: Paths in Graphs 2* Start Assignment 5: Minimum Spanning Trees Description Outside of lists, sets &amp; hash maps, graphs are one of the most common and useful data structures you will encounter in your programming career. Graphs are useful in a wide variety different contexts such as mapping, social networks, geometry &amp; artificial intelligence. See https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs for more info on this course. Coursera offers a free \"auditor\" option and a paid option, if you want a certificate at the end. How to Participate 1. Watch the lectures and start the week's assignments.2. Find something in the week's content you found interesting and maybe research it a little more.3. At the meetup, we go around the room and each person gets a chance to tell the group about the thing they found interesting or ask questions.4. Group discussion and friendly banter ensues! All are welcome – beginners, experts, students and professionals. Book club is held at Tim &amp; Wei's residence 244A Tanjong Katong RdSingapore 437032Singapore  Doors open at 6:30, meetup starts at 7.Bring healthy snacks and drinks of your choice!
