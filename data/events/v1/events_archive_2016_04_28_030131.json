Agenda: April 28th - 6:45 PM to 7 PM - Registration and Snacks 7 PM to 8 PM - Topic 1 - Presentation by Matt Hitchcock 8:00 PM to 8:15 - Break 8:15 PM to 9:15 - Topic 2 - Presentation by Nagaraj Venkatesan Location: Microsoft Office, One Marina Boulevard, Conf Room SINOMB 22CF-12 Topic 1: Deploying SQL Clusters in Azure: Tales from the field Synopsis: As more workloads move to the cloud, some workloads still have a requirement to run their databases on non-PaaS SQL servers. Cloud does not automatically mean Always On and Highly Available, so the requirement for Clusters is alive and well! In this Tales from the Field, Matt talks about implementing SQL Clusters in Azure as part of a production project for a high profile customer. We will cover why Clusters were required in the first place, how we approached the planning (networks, backup, VM Sizes, HA, etc.), what implementation steps were involved, where we got help, lessons we learned and most importantly; how we would do it differently if we had to do it today! This is what we learned along the road of a project that Satya himself has been tracking ... Don't screw up!! Speaker Profile: Matthew Hitchcock Matthew, a Microsoft MVP, has deep experience of Identity &amp; Directory Services including Hybrid Identity for Cloud. He now specializes in Microsoft Azure and currently works at Microsoft Services, helping customers to automate their operations, start dealing with Infrastructure-as-Code and to adopt Cloud solutions. Topic 2:  Optimizer's choice of Indexes Synopsis: Indexes are perhaps the key parameter in deciding the performance of a query. Hence, understanding how an index is picked by query optimizer becomes extremely vital performance tuning. The presentation would explain how optimizer choses an index at diferent scenarios discussing the reasons for optimizer's choices. Session would be a Demo driven one, driving home the importance of designing optimizer friendly indexes.  Speaker Profile: Nagaraj Venkatesan Nagaraj Venkatesan, a SQL Server enthusiast exploring SQL Server for the last 10 years.
