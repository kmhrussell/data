We have a privilege to have Randy Fitton (Director of BD &amp; Sales, Noviflow), a veteran in network &amp; telco technology, to share his thoughts on future-proofing your networking. Randy Fitton has twenty-seven years of experience in the telecommunications industry. Managing large and start-up teams for a variety of technical areas such as: SDN, NFV, OpenStack, OpenDaylight, datacentre, mobile broadband implementation and optimization, OSS/BSS including delivery of the services on the cloud, traffic management, service creation and network policy control for fixed, 3GPP and 3GPP2 environments, IMS, content cache, ad insertion, threat mitigation, network management and network demographics solutions (for fixed, wireless, IPTV and NGN networks), WiMax, LMDS, NGN fixed/mobile with H.323 and SIP, IPTV, managed services, unified messaging and traditional broadband networking appliances and software. A Permanent Resident of Singapore since 2005. Randy has resided in Korea, Japan, Malaysia, China and Singapore while supporting business in the entire AsiaPac region. NoviFlow provides “Carrier Grade” SDN performance - large data centre operators and service providers will only fully embrace NFV and SDN once solutions meet their performance requirements: scalability, wire speed, dynamic programmability, and transparent multi-tenancy. NoviSwitch - NoviFlow’s OpenFlow switches utilise network processors that combine the speed of an ASIC with the openness and programmability of a vSwitch. Consequently, we offer high performance Ethernet switches that can meet the requirements of large data centre operators and service providers. High-Performance SDN Solutions - at NoviFlow we've developed solutions that leverage the unique capabilities of SDN and OpenFlow to solve real customer problems, that preserve existing investments in both capital and organizational competencies. Scale-Out Router - use SDN and OpenFlow to implement a fully functional, centrally controlled and reliable network router that is easier to scale more economical to operate. Data Centre Gateways - the network edge is becoming a major bottleneck for traffic and revenue growth. SDN can help resolve these challenges at the DC edge. VSwitch Offload – a vSwitch Offload solution that will reduce capital expenditures by up to ~45% over an Open vSwitch solution. Intelligent TOR Switches - the Cloud, and virtualisation all require the same agility and flow management capabilities at the Top-of-Rack as is normally expected at the network edge. SDN provides a whole new set of tools for managing data growth, multi tenancy and traffic isolation.  This event is sponsored by Noviflow. Pizza will be provided starting 6pm.
