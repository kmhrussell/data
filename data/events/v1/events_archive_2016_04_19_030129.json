However, using them can be daunting, where developers not only have to understand the syntax but also the semantics of these esoteric constructs. This talk discusses how to best leverage actors to build Reactive application that are fault tolerant and elastic in scale, and includes use cases for building self-healing systems that do not depend on the ordered timing of events, as well as how to compose distributed transactions and build domain-specific behavior for varying kinds of failure that may occur. Bio: Jamie Allen is the Senior Director of Strategic Enablement Services for Typesafe, responsible for the enablement of customers around the world through consulting and training. He is the author of Effective Akka (O’Reilly), and the co-author of the soon-to-be-released Reactive Design Patterns (Manning). Jamie is a computer languages enthusiast who enjoys writing performant code that most efficiently leverages the resources at hand.","location":" #03-04, IDA labs @ National Design Centre,  #03-04, 111 Middle Road, 188969, Singapore","rsvp_count":104,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Scala-Programmers/events/229726536/","group_id":12690122,"group_name":"Singapore Scala Programmers","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Scala-Programmers","formatted_time":"19 Apr 2016, Tue, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2016-04-19T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-04-19T13:30:00.000Z","latitude":1.29891,"longitude":103.853188}]}
