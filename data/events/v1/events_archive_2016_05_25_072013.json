Every component, device, and system that relies on software is a part of an interconnected cyber supply chain that we have become increasingly dependent on – and every link in that chain is an attack vector through which an adversary could potentially cause harm, often with rippling effects.   Modern software development practices dominated by component-based engineering and short development cycles have largely been a catalyst for rapid advancements in technology. These practices, however, have also resulted in an epidemic of known vulnerabilities baked into third-party software components of IoT applications and devices. These widespread security flaws, many of which are critical in nature, often remain unnoticed or unaddressed throughout the software or device lifecycle, posing significant risks to the people and organizations that rely on them.   During this presentation, Synopsis will share about the problem of an ever changing threat landscape, which Synopsys can address today by its best in class solutions from Static Code Analysis, Supply Chain Management to Fuzzing. Included in the seminar is a free binary scan using the Protecode SC application composition analysis scanner. You can bring any binaries that you are working on (refer to this page for more information).   Agenda    3:00pm - 3:30pm Overview of Synopsys SIG products 3:30pm – 4:00pm Static code analysis with Code Advisor and Test Advisor 4:00pm - 4:30pm IoT security in today’s world (Defensics) 4:30pm – 5:00pm Binary scanning and software composition analysis (Protecode SC)   About the speakers  Darence Tan is a Regional Sales Manager with Synopsys Singapore.  He oversees the South Asia region, namely Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan etc.  He has been with Synopsys for over 17 years.  He is actively involved in the business development and manpower development programs in South Asia working with various multi-national companies, government organizations, universities, research institutes and startups.
