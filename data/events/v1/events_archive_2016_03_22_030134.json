Docker has reached out to us and will be helping us out (speakers, venues etc) so we expect to see a rise in the Docker meetups being hosted :D And... Docker Project’s 3rd birthday! We are in the midst of organizing the meetup and there will be training (we hope to get everything and everyone in place in time) to show them how they can build, ship, and run a distributed application with ease thanks to the Docker platform. IF you an advanced user? We strongly encourage Docker users of all skill levels to attend! We need a network of mentors who understand the Docker platform to answer any questions that newcomers may have. Click here to sign up as a mentor. Mentors for should have experience working with: • Docker Engine • Docker Networking • Docker Hub and/or Tutum • Docker Machine • Docker Swarm • Docker Compose \n\n\nCheers!

This week we'll be covering the chapters on Erlang.  \n\n\n\"Just as each new spoken language can make you smarter and increase your options, each programming language increases your mental tool kit, adding new abstractions you can throw at each new problem. \" How Book Club Works1. Read the chapter before you come to the meetup.2. Find something in the chapter you found interesting and maybe research it a little more.3. At the meetup, we go around the room and each person gets a chance to tell the group about the thing they found interesting.4. Group discussion and banter ensues!
