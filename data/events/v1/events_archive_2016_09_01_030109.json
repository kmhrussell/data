Agile teams understand the process of build, test and deploy. They have largely automated this process in a delivery pipeline, they deploy to production multiple times per day but the big challenge is how can they do this securely?  This session will focus on a strategy to build an application security pipeline, challenges and possible solutions, also how existing application security solutions (SAST, DAST, IAST, OpenSource Libraries Analysis) are playing a key role in growing the relationship between Agile &amp; Security  Join us in this hands-on in-depth technical w​alk-through on ​the workflows to build a pipeline to deliver microservices with Cloud Foundry Speaker Bio Suman has more than a decade experience in designing software security defense programs and is passionate about integrating security into the development lifecycle. He has worked with various financial and non-financial institutions to implement software security life-cycle, currently he is working as Principal Security Consultant with Vantage Point Security where he is helping clients to implement secure SDLC in DevOps platform and helping them to create a roadmap of relevant processes and policies changes to achieve organisational application security goals.  \n\nHe is the co-founder of DevSecOps Singapore to build a local community of developers, testers, architects, sysadmins and security folks to explore proven and novel ways to put security into DevOps and build it into the SDLC, end-to-end. ","location":"Thoughtworks, 87B Amoy Street #04, Singapore 069906, Singapore","rsvp_count":60,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/devops-singapore/events/233552105/","group_id":3202252,"group_name":"DevOps Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/devops-singapore","formatted_time":"01 Sep 2016, Thu, 6:45 pm","start_time":"2016-09-01T10:45:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-09-01T12:45:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.28094,"longitude":103.847076},{"id":"232911449","name":"Deep learning for java (DL4J) - Adam Gibson","description":"Deep learning for Java DL4J creator Adam Gibson will be in Singapore.  If you have any topics you want to learn more about please drop us a comment on our facebook page.
