We have an exhibit stall in the Tech section of MF this weekend Sat and Sun[masked]hrs. In addition to showcasing our equipment and projects, we will conduct 15-min demo's on the hour between 11am and 5pm: • Learn how to Mod and Improv a Biolab for under $100 • See what Microbes are Used in our Food • Get tips on Culturing Bacteria and Fungi at Home We will also be making available Microbial Culture Kits for the first time. We're keen to share ideas on how as a BioScience Community we can explore and catalog the Diversity of Microbiomes in our Food and Environment. More importantly, as we have received tremendous interest, we are considering launching a series of monthly meet-ups and projects. What are your interests and needs? What have you been doing or hope to try? How can a community of scientists and amateurs help you? Would hands-on workshops be of interest? Prof Eric and Dr Siva from NTU are keen to chat with you.  More info at: www.OpenBio.asia","location":"SUTD Multi-Purpose Hall, 8 Somapah Road, Singapore","rsvp_count":3,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/OpenBio-Singapore/events/232103780/","group_id":20105926,"group_name":"OpenBio Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/OpenBio-Singapore","formatted_time":"25 Jun 2016, Sat, 10:00 am","start_time":"2016-06-25T02:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-06-26T10:00:00.000Z","latitude":1.340103,"longitude":103.962952},{"id":"231682769","name":"Shapeways @ Singapore Maker Faire 2016","description":"Not really a meetup but we'll be having some booths (with our friends) and have a showcase of some of the awesome 3d printed stuff from Shapeways over at Singapore Makers Faire 2016!
