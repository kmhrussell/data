If you're interesting in giving a talk to the BTC community in SG, sharing your idea &amp; startup, getting beta users, etc., let me know. We're looking to have a few meetups with awesome speakers &amp; thought leaders starting the night's conversation. -------- Side note: Sarnie's cafe accepts Bitcoin, and they're really being cool by giving us so much of their space at peak hours to have our meetup there. So, it's cool and supportive if you order from their menu (for bitcoin, of course). They also happen to make shockingly delicious food (I highly recommend the Chicken In A Paper Bag), and damn good coffee (their own custom house blend).","location":"Sarnies, 136 Telok Ayer , Singapore","rsvp_count":9,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/BitcoinSingapore/events/229737946/","group_id":8103652,"group_name":"Bitcoins in Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/BitcoinSingapore","formatted_time":"30 Mar 2016, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-03-30T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-03-30T13:00:00.000Z","latitude":1.28166,"longitude":103.8479},{"id":"229275133","name":"Hackware v1.6","description":"Hackware is a monthly meetup for hardware developers and enthusiasts to share hacks and developments in the hardware scene, promote hardware development and to build a community of hardware developers.  Come and just drop by for all our open and free meetups, make friends with fellow enthusiasts or beginners and feel free to sign up for a talk slot on whatever you are working on.
