This month at Singapore SQL Pass Chapter (User Group), we are going to have two eminent speakers presenting on couple of most happening topics on SQL Server. On March 17th, we will have Mr. Edwin Sarimento (MCM, MVP) and Mr. Martin Catherall ( MVP, Regional Mentor - APAC - SQLPASS) sharing their knowledge in our user group. I extend a warm welcome to both of them on the behalf of SG SQL PASS Chapter. I strongly urge everyone to attend the meetup, as sessions as this one are mostly available only on paid conferences and technical summits. Don't miss it!!! Venue, Agenda and Event details are provided below. Agenda:  Mar 17th - 6:45 PM to 7 PM - Registration and Snacks 7 PM to 8:15 PM - Topic 1 - Presentation by Edwin Sarimento 8:15 PM to 8:30 - Break 8:30 PM to 9:30 - Topic 2 - Presentation by Martin Catherall Location: Microsoft Office, One Marina Boulevard, Conf Room SINOMB 22CF-15 (24) AV Topic 1: 5 Things To Consider: Stretching SQL Server Failover Clustered Instances and Availability Groups to Microsoft Azure Dealing with SQL Server Failover Clustered Instances and Availability Group for local high availability is already complicated with a lot of the external dependencies such as the network and the Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC.) But it becomes even more complicated when you stretch it out for disaster recovery to Microsoft Azure. In this session, learn the five (5) things that you need to consider when you implement SQL Server Failover Clustered Instances and Availability Group for disaster recovery into Microsoft Azure. We will cover how Active Directory, DNS, WSFC heartbeat and quorum configuration affects deployments of SQL Server Failover Clustered Instances and Availability Group in a disaster recovery site and how to properly configure a client application for connectivity. Speaker Profile: Edwin Sarimento Edwin M. Sarmiento is the Managing Director of 15C, a consulting and training company that specializes on designing, implementing and supporting SQL Server infrastructures. He is a  Microsoft SQL Server MVP and Microsoft Certified Master from Ottawa, Canada specializing in high availability, disaster recovery and system infrastructures running on the Microsoft server technology stack ranging from Active Directory to SharePoint and anything in between. He is very passionate about technology but has interests in music, professional and organizational development, and leadership and management matters when not working with databases. Edwin lives up to his primary mission statement: \"To help people and organizations grow and develop their full potential.\" Topic 2:  A Lap around Columnstore Columnstore indexing was first introduced in SQL Server 2012, however it was not widely adopted.SQL Server 2014 added additional functionality to columnstore which resulted in a marginally higher uptake. The initial versions required some creative thinking to get all of the promised performance gains out of the technology. Now, SQL Server 2016 enhances this functionality greatly and it’s all set to become mainstream. Columnstore promises significant performance gains for datawarehouses along with operational analytics. This presentation will look at many of the new features in columnstore as well as briefly look at some of the internals and give the audience some insight into how they can leverage its potential. Speaker Profile: Martin Catherall Martin is a RockSolid SQL consultant, a SQL Server MVP, PASS Regional Mentor for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region and until recently leader of the Christchurch, New Zealand SQL Server User Group. Now based in Melbourne, he’s getting to know the Australian SQL community. He has been using SQL Server in various roles since 2000. In addition to anything data related be enjoys playing the guitar and having fun with his family.","location":"Microsoft Singapore, One Marina Boulevard, Level 22, Meeting Room","rsvp_count":50,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/mssgug/events/229405273/","group_id":18429776,"group_name":"Microsoft User Groups (Singapore)","group_url":"http://meetup.com/mssgug","formatted_time":"17 Mar 2016, Thu, 6:45 pm","start_time":"2016-03-17T10:45:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-03-17T12:45:00.000Z"},{"id":"228820573","name":"Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template Scripts for Beginners!","description":"Hi All, After absence for 2 months, we are back! We going to have meetup and talk about Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template scripts. It will be #LSFD (less slides, full demos) meetup. This is for beginners (not just for Azure beginners) who don't understand how to create Cloud Infrastructure by just using a simple JSON text file. No, it's not Powershell file, no coding scripts. It's just a JSON text file. This text file can than be executed in Azure Resource Manager. Here is what you will get from the talk: 1. Understand what is ARM and what is Template Scripts, what is JSON (for those who don't know). 2. Understand how to create a simple implicit VM using ARM scripts and execute in Azure. Update the scripts and automate it. 3. Translate (interpret) an architectural design and generate the Scripts. 4. Creating more complex design such as multiple VMs with Virtual Network, Load Balancers, MySql, DocumentDB, App Services, etc. 5. Accessing ARM through API using .NET (as an example). 5. And lots of Live Demos. So, basically ARM template scripts is like your cloud infrastructure meta data file (blueprint file) that can be edited/saved and reuse or for automation. \n\n\nSPEAKER Azure Cloud Expert Juv Chan (Chan Kae Siang). He Studied Computer Engineering at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore back in 2004. \n\n\nSeriously, this will be tons of new knowledge for beginners and you don't want to miss this topic. See you at the venue!
