It is stealthful, silent, hard to detect and yet fatal. Worse, today, many of such attacks are turning their targets from just PCs to critical infra-structures like vessels, oil rigs, energy, water and nuclear plants.Many anti-malware today are failing as they could not cope with the rapid advancement of attack techniques and viruses. We need a more strategic approach and stronger tools to counter them. One of the key starting points is to perform professional assessment of the vulnerability of systems. 11.00am – 11.30amBreak 11.30am – 12.15pmIOT Security - Do you know you have a backdoor in your smart devices?Speaker: Mr Robert L. Arquiza, Trainer and Consultant, Worldtech Information Solutions, Inc. Twenty years ago, if you told me my phone could be used to steal the password to my email account or to take a copy of my fingerprint data, I would’ve laughed at you and said you watch too much James Bond. But today, if you tell me that hackers with malicious intents can use my toaster to break into my Facebook account, I will panic and quickly pull the plug from the evil appliance.Welcome to the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), where digitally connected devices are encroaching on every aspect of our lives, including our homes, offices, cars and even our bodies. With the advent of IPv6 and the wide deployment of Wi-Fi networks, IoT is growing at a dangerously fast pace, and researchers estimate that by 2020, the number of active wireless connected devices will exceed 40 billion.

There is a multitude of ways to share and reuse software amongst organisations and the public sector employs (and has employed) a variety of different approaches. This session will specifically focus on open source software and the factors influencing the adoption of open source software within public sector organisations. The primary objective of the session is to explore open source software benefits for public sector organisations, discuss the current state of adoption, and review the motivators and a-motivators affecting adoption. A secondary objective of the session is to investigate where organisations are utilising open source software and whether organisations consider open source software as a means of achieving business goals. \n\n\nAbout Norvan Vogt: Norvan is passionate about open source technology and using ICT to make a difference in the world.

In fact, it assumes a poor network and accounts it from day one.\n\nThe Wobe architecture is asynchronous and event/message based vs. the more common synchronous architectures. It’s comprised of a mobile client for Android and a collection of microservices developed in Go. It’s designed to work in high latency, low bandwidth environments and poor reliability network access.\n\nIn addition, Jordan will be sharing Wobe’s plans for open sourcing significant components of its architecture to help others adopt a better mobile services architecture. If you are looking for an interesting, approachable, challenging open source to contribute to, this is your chance to learn more.\n\nSpeaker Profile\n\nJordan Dea-Mattson (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordandeamattson) is a 30+ veteran of HighTech with most of that time spent working in Silicon Valley. Jordan has worked at Apple (13 years), Adobe Systems, Ooyala, and Yahoo among other companies.\n\nJordan has spent his career focused on efficiently and effectively building and delivering high quality software and enabling others to do so as well.\n\nJordan has spoken at numerous industry events, including Apple’s WWDC (12 straight years), Atlassian’s Summit, and ChefConf.\n\nCompany Profile\n\nWobe (http://wobe.io) founded by long-time Singapore and South East Asia innovator and entrepreneur, Adrianna Tan, delivers a brand new take on financial services to the underserved — low income women in emerging markets.\n\nThrough their app, young urban and rural entrepreneurs can start small businesses: they can resell phone airtime and other pre-paid goods and services to their friends and family. Most Wobe agents will be able to easily increase their family income by $US 10 a day, moving them solidly into the emerging middle class.\n\n\nFree pizzas as usual!\n\nMore information here: http://nushackers.org/2016/03/friday-hacks-110-Mar-18\n\nOur Sponsors\n\nFriday Hacks is sponsored by the NUS Enterprise Center.\n\nIf you are looking to turn your ideas into a startup and would love some business support, feel free to get in touch with Agustiadi from NUS Enterprise: agustiadi@nus.edu.sg","location":"Seminar Room 3, Town Plaza, UTown, NUS","rsvp_count":11,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/201178496916684","group_id":"164904410234667","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/164904410234667","formatted_time":"18 Mar 2016, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-03-18T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-03-18T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"1319749338040962","name":"TGIFHacks #49 - node.JS","description":"node.JS is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side JavaScript applications used in many web applications today.
