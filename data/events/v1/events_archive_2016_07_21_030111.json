Apache Apex Data Ingestion is a standalone big data application that simplifies the collection, aggregation and movement of large amounts of data to and from Hadoop for a more efficient data processing pipeline. Apache Apex Data Ingestion makes configuring and running Hadoop data ingestion and data extraction a point and click process enabling a smooth, easy path to your Hadoop-based big data project. In this series of talks, we would cover how Hadoop Ingestion is made easy using Apache Apex. The second talk in this series would focus on ingesting unbounded data from Kafka to HDFS with couple of processing operators - Transform and enrichment. Please register for the webinar at: https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/7322083711883921923 After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the webinar. Apache Apex is a next generation native Hadoop data in motion platform that is being used by customers for both streaming as well as batch processing. Common use cases include ingestion into Hadoop, streaming analytics, ETL, database off-loads, alerts and monitoring, machine model scoring, etc. Apache Apex completely separates operational logic from business logic, and handles all operational aspects. This enables developers to concentrate on business logic and reduce time to market as well as total cost of ownership.  For deeper engagement with Apache Apex - follow ApacheApex, presentations, recordings, download (community, sandbox), Apache Apex releases, docs  This webcast is of Ingest &amp; Transform meetup event done earlier in Pune, IN and we are webcasting it enable other Big Data Ingesters to participate. If you are interested in helping organize (hosting, presenting, community leadership) Big Data Ingestion community, please email [masked]","location":"Webcast, Online, Singapore","rsvp_count":16,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Ingest-Singapore/events/232597177/","group_id":20146922,"group_name":"Big Data (Next Gen Hadoop) Ingest & Transform, Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Big-Data-Ingest-Singapore","formatted_time":"21 Jul 2016, Thu, 10:30 pm","start_time":"2016-07-21T14:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-07-21T16:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.355379,"longitude":103.867744}]}
