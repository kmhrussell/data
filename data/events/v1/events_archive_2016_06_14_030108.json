Presently, many information retrieval systems work through similarity measures or a generative statistical model. The Web 3.0 makes information retrieval more structured through a RDF format / triples relationship. Thomson Reuters has existing initiatives like the OpenCalais and the open source PermIDs to facilitate information retrieval. PermIDs are immutable 64bit identifiers on entities that are consistent across different domains. There are Python APIs for OpenCalais. Through triples relationships, entities are linked in a semantic web. Some applications in finance can be found in credit risk network, KYC, supply chain risks or portfolio risk management. Speaker: Eric Tham is presently an Enterprise Data Scientist with Thomson Reuters. He was previously in a startup in China doing NLP and sentiment analysis; He has presented and published papers in sentiment analysis and Energy Economics. He has spoken in Pycon APAC and will also be speaking in the forthcoming Strata and Hadoop conference. He has a Masters degree in Financial Engineering from Columbia University and a MSBA from NUS. • 8:00pm-8:15pm Lightning Talk: Pair Data Science - Learning machine learning from past Kaggle competitions by Chen Zhenhao Synopsis: Zhenhao will be sharing his learning journey in machine learning with Amazon's Employee Access Challenge dataset on Kaggle. Speaker: Zhenhao is an application analyst at DHL Express. He started learning machine learning after attending Andrew Ng's machine learning online course last year.

There is little or no guidance. \n  \nMost beginners don’t know that there is in fact, a simple way to start investing. \n  \nRead on to find out how an ordinary undergraduate and café barista had managed to JUMPSTART his investing empire with just $500 capital, in this letter below: \n   \n\"Dear Students,   \nI would like to take to share with you my story. Hopefully, it will inspire you in one way or another. I am from Malaysia. At the age of 12 years old, I came to Singapore with scholarship for a better education. Even though I was young, it wasn't exactly a tough decision for my family and I. Having a scholarship to fund my tuition fees, accommodation and living expenses means we have less to worry about.   \nBut things took a turn for the worse - After my \"A\" Levels result missed the expected grade, I did not qualify for a continuation of the scholarship. Nonetheless, I was eager to enter into a Singapore local university, even though it was costly. So my family and I took out a hefty bank loan and I started my tertiary education in NUS.   \nThroughout my undergraduate studies in NUS, I was very wary of my expenses. With the regular appreciation of the Singapore Dollar against the Malaysia Ringgit, I had to work hard as a Barista in a café to fund myself. My course mates often tease me for my constant state of frustration. On top of that, I had to fulfil my duty with hall activities, in order to qualify for a spot in hall for cheap accommodation!  \nI barely managed my first year in NUS. Balancing all these different aspects had taken a toll on me as an undergraduate. Finally I couldn’t take it anymore. I decided to halt all my involvement in hall activities, took a break from studies, and stop socialising all together. I considered dropping out. I was tired. I was desperate.  \nOne day I had enough, and I took a leap of faith.  \nI started SOCIAL TRADING. I not only invested into the forex market, I invested into the idea of setting aside a small capital to COPY top traders in order to profit. This simple concept and technology was AMAZING. It was exactly what I was looking for. I opened a $500 account and immediately started following and copying top traders on a social trading platform. It was surprisingly easy.  \nI was pleasantly SHOCKED when months later, I found that my ROI of $500 was over 250%! But not without taking calculated risk and taking small losses. At the end of the day, I realized that investing and trading CAN be very profitable!  \nSocial trading hence started a burning desire in me to learn more, and to improve myself. I started my education on investing and trading and I never looked back since. Today I am very happy to say that I am now a full time forex trader and investor.   \nStudents or young executives, if you can relate to what I shared and you would like to do something about your situation, I want YOU to remember this 3 takeaways:   \n1.   STOP being a financial burden. Start thinking about how you can be FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT, and even contribute to your family. It isn’t easy, but all actions starts with a thought.  \n2.   START LIVING. Steve Jobs put it well: your time is limited. Don’t waste it on living somebody else’s life. Don’t let the noise of other people’s opinions drown your own voice. Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. Somehow, they already know what you truly want to become.  \n 3.   FOCUS on ONE thing.  You don’t have to be good at everything. Look at the successful people around you. All of them simply have to master one thing and be the expert of one thing, and build their success around just one thing. Yes, just ONE! For me, it was looking for the right Master Trader to copy. Eventually, I became a Master Trader myself. \nThank you for reading – Kar Yong\" \nA self-taught trader, Kar Yong was interviewed in Channel Newsasia’s Money Mind Young Investor in 2013.
