Please suggest somewhere in the West side of Singapore for a meetup. Personally, I am quite cheapo, so I don't mind a kopitiam somewhere, otherwise anywhere with coffee or beer can do too! Edit: we will meet at jurong East MRT kopitiam A few things to think about are: 1 - Do we actually need a space to make stuff? 2 - How can we create/find a cosy place near home, where we can make stuff? 3 - How would you like this group to be? 4 - What is your story? How did you start trying to make stuff? Don't be shy to comment on these questions before our meet in the comments section. It will be cool to meet with some awesome fun-loving people without travelling too much, so enjoy it! -Jerome","location":"Jurong East MRT Kopitiam, Jurong East MRT, Singapore","rsvp_count":5,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Wild-West-Makers/events/232109419/","group_id":20057167,"group_name":"Wild West Makers","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Wild-West-Makers","formatted_time":"07 Jul 2016, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-07-07T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-07-07T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.333134,"longitude":103.742287},{"id":"tpjvvlyvkbkb","name":"On-going: Functional Programming in Scala Coursera Study Group","description":"Study group for the Coursera Functional Programming in Scala Specialization, and all of it's courses.  Anyone may attend regardless of your progress in the courses.  We're here to help.
