Anmol brings to the table 8 years of experience in Data Mining, Pattern Recognition, and Machine Learning. Throughout his career, Anmol has helped various clients across US, Europe, India and South-East Asia with their requirements in business, behavioural and marketing analytics. Having graduated in Mechanical Engineering from Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad, Anmol decided to make a career in a field of his choice where he can utilise his natural enthusiasm towards Logic and Mathematics. He took up an analytical position in consulting firm ZS Associates to begin his career but quickly developed an itch to create something on his own. To gain experience, he worked for several startups and numerous clients in India. Before joining Paktor as Head of Data Analytics, Anmol was instrumental in setting up Data Mining team and processes from scratch in Metro AG, a Global Fortune 100 company. Apart from his love of solving puzzles, Anmol spends his spare time playing and composing music. He plays seven different musical instruments and also maintains a blog where he writes about social evolution. Anmol wants to use his knowledge to create technologies which can bring advances in Data Science to masses and help in the development of society as a whole.  Vinod Venkatasubramanian is Director of Client Solutions, Asia-Pacific at Opower. In this role, he focuses on sales and market development for Opower in SE Asia, Greater China and India. Opower is a SaaS + B2B2C software company that enables utilities to grab the attention of traditionally apathetic energy consumers to drive both social outcomes (ex. energy efficiency), and business outcomes (ex. customer care, operational benefits, reduced peak demand). Combining behavioural science, world class design &amp; cloud based \"big data\" analytics, Opower's no hardware approach has proven to be the most capital-light approach to energy efficiency globally. Opower was founded in 2007, went public in 2014 and is now a Oracle company. Prior to Opower, Vinod spent ~12 years in various roles with Cognizant Technology Solutions. In his last role there, he focused on driving \"digital\" for Fortune 500 clients in Financial services, Retail &amp; CPG, Media, Power utilities &amp; Telecom industries. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Special thanks to our host NUS Enterprise.

There are absolutely no fees. Just come with an open mind and willingness to share and learn  Agenda :  Introduction &amp; Networking An introduction to YARA by Matt Brooks CTF, the scene in Singapore by Jeremy Heng (each talk is of 40 mins)   Abstract: An Introduction to YARA  This talk covers the basics of YARA, illustrates two use-cases, then leaves the listener with places to learn more. It was recently given at FIRST 2016 in Seoul, Korea. CTF, the scene in Singapore The existing Security Capture-the-Flag (CTF) scene in Singapore is designed with a macroscopic view of security: primarily focused on the security of enterprise systems, networks, and applications in the style of a penetration test. Additionally, most of the Singaporean CTFs are designed to be beginner friendly, require the use of publicly available tools and exploits, and typically serve as an introduction to security for students. However, this particular emphasis leads to a lack of ‘traditional’ CTF competitions where challenges revolve around novel and interesting vulnerabilities and their custom built exploits. The Cross Varsity CTF (X-CTF) Competition organised by the NUS Greyhats is an attempt to fill this void. Twenty-two teams were selected from schools in Singapore in an open online qualifiers to compete in the Finals held on the 18th of July 2016. Challenges the participants had to solve include an IoT-style hardware badge, breaking out of restricted shells, automated speed reverse engineering, and interesting web vulnerabilities. In this talk, we will present the hardware badge design and fabrication process, an overview of the gameplay infrastructure, and a demonstration of some of the interesting challenges. \n\nSpeaker Bio: Matt spends his days leading security intelligence and operations at a large Fortune 500 company. He spends his nights researching malware and disclosing targeted threats against Civil Society. Jeremy (@nn_amon) is an information security student at the National University of Singapore and a core committee member of the NUS Greyhats. He is a co-founder of the Dystopian Narwhals CTF team and enjoys participating in both local and online CTF events around the World.  Jeremias is a Computer Engineering student at the National University of Singapore and a member of NUS Hackers. He likes to spend his time breaking hardware devices \n\n\n\nSee you all there, Null SG core team.","location":"KPMG clubhouse, City House, 36 Robinson Rd, , Singapore","rsvp_count":70,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Null-Singapore-The-Open-Security-Community/events/232044851/","group_id":18493025,"group_name":"Null Singapore - The Open Security Community","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Null-Singapore-The-Open-Security-Community","formatted_time":"29 Jun 2016, Wed, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-06-29T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-06-29T12:30:00.000Z","latitude":1.28119,"longitude":103.8498},{"id":"231849930","name":"Windows containers, Docker on Windows, DevOps with Docker","description":" \n\n\nHi all, Here are the topics for June's meetup 1) Introduction to Windows containers, Nano servers, Docker for Windows (Riza) 2) Continuous integration and continuous delivery for Docker 3) Visual Studio Team Services sprint 100 updates Meet up starts at 7pm Food at 6.45","location":"Microsoft Auditorium (Singapore), One Marina Boulevard, Level 21 Auditorium, Singapore 018989 ","rsvp_count":76,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/tfs-sg/events/231849930/","group_id":18847677,"group_name":"Visual Studio ALM Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/tfs-sg","formatted_time":"29 Jun 2016, Wed, 6:45 pm","start_time":"2016-06-29T10:45:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-06-29T12:45:00.000Z","latitude":1.282387,"longitude":103.85244},{"id":"1713394688911340","name":"Design in Motion","description":"RSVP for free here: http://ga.co/28Mdtol\n \nDesign experts:\nShah Widjaja (Principal UX Consultant and Founder of Nmbl Consulting, Head of UX at Palo IT)\nFern Yit Lim (Digital Strategy Director, BBDO/Proximity Singapore)\nJing Xin Yip (Interactive Experience, IBM)\n\nDesign thinking is a human-centred approach to problem solving that involves firstly defining the right problem to solve then testing different ideas until an effective solution is found. It can be used to solve a myriad of problems, and creating dynamic web experiences that are user-friendly, attention-grabbing, and on brand are what product and user experience designers face every day. That’s why we asked a panel of Singapore’s best to a hypothetical design problem in view of the upcoming Rio 2016 Summer Olympic Games.\n\nThe brief we will tackle during this session is as follows:\n\n\"You are a user experience designer at NBC. In the months leading up to the Olympic Games in Rio, your design team has been enlisted to increase viewership and engagement for one of the most overlooked events: race walking. It’s your goal to keep audiences tuned in — and clicking — on NBC’s website.

A compositional type system is one where typing judgements are local, i.e. only using the typing judgements of immediate subexpressions. I'll explain a particular compositional type system that agrees with HM on well-typed expressions, and show a practical implementation for a small model language. \n\n\n2.  Paul Meng: Writing Atom plugin with GHCJS This is the second in the Haskell editor mini-hacking series. Following the last month's Neovim session, it is to encourage the new-comer to start hacking on Haskell with the editor you use daily. And this month we are going to hack on Atom.
