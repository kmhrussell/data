We would have some time for them to introduce us their PaaS/BaaS platform which is mostly built on Haskell implementation, and demonstrate us how to use their platform to prototype some hacks (ideally in Haskell for sure).  As usual, it is a casual weekend hack. No matter it is you are having some questions on learning Haskell, or you are working on Haskell projects, or have no idea about how to get started. Please come and we could offer helps on your questions and project.   \n\n\nAbout Hasura: Hasura is a platform for building scalable application backends, while retaining complete control. With out of the box APIs for database, search, authentication, etc., Hasura minimises the time taken to build your application backend. It is built on top of Kubernetes, Docker, CoreOS and is designed to be run anywhere; from a dev machine to a bare metal environment; a single node to a cluster; our most recent instant deployment was on a VMWare cluster for a payment wallet startup in India. This PaaS + BaaS solution arose out of the very real need of having to build applications rapidly and then having to maintain them (like Django &amp; RoR). Hasura puts together all the best platform components along with the best application components like PostgresQL, Redis, Nginx and glues everything together to create a seamless, yet open experience for the developer. ","location":"Hackerspace.SG, 344B King George's Ave, King George's Building, Singapore","rsvp_count":11,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/HASKELL-SG/events/231883263/","group_id":11260962,"group_name":"HASKELL.SG","group_url":"http://meetup.com/HASKELL-SG","formatted_time":"18 Jun 2016, Sat, 2:00 pm","start_time":"2016-06-18T06:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-06-18T08:00:00.000Z","latitude":1.31041,"longitude":103.862358},{"id":"231504730","name":"FPV Racing - 1st Prize 4x BLheli_S ESCs sponsored by 65drones.com","description":"Upcoming race event: Saturday 18th JuneVenue: OutramRegistration &amp; briefing: 3pm sharp! Format: 2 minute most laps. 2 practice rounds, 5 heats with 1 discard. Head to head first past the post finals between the top three (or more in the event of a tie). Classes: Novice / Open. Novice class has no prizes / league points, but course layout is easier. League points: 5 for 1st, 4 for 2nd, 3 for 3rd, 1 for competing. NEW: League tables will be maintained after each league event. League events will be maximum 1 per calendar month. League score will consist of each pilots top 5 scores out of 8 most recent events (so not being able to attend one or two events will not be a penalty) Organisation: Groups of three fliers based on frequency allocations. Each group will 'spot' for the previous group - meaning they will take care of counting laps for the respective members of the previous group and observe correct negotiation of the course and obstacles.","location":"Behind Outram Park MRT, 1A Pearl Bank, Singapore","rsvp_count":20,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/dronesg/events/231504730/","group_id":18318692,"group_name":"Singapore FPV Fun Meetup (Drone Fun)","group_url":"http://meetup.com/dronesg","formatted_time":"18 Jun 2016, Sat, 3:00 pm","start_time":"2016-06-18T07:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-06-18T10:00:00.000Z","latitude":1.282631,"longitude":103.839241}]}
