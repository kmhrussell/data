Venue: Level 3 at Grab R&amp;D Center Speaker: Romain Huet Agenda: • 06:30 pm: Come, have some food and network • 07:15 pm: Stripe iOS SDK and how to use Stripe with Apple Pay • 08:00 pm: Hands-on. Build your own sample app and integrate Apple Pay in your app using Stripe. • 09:00 pm: Quick show and tell About the Speaker: Romain leads global developer relations at Stripe. He joined Stripe from Twitter, where he helped launch Fabric, Twitter’s mobile development platform, and Digits, a way for people to securely sign in to apps with their phone number rather than a password. Prior to Twitter, Romain was co-founder &amp; CTO Jolicloud, whose free operating system was designed to work on low cost computers and connect them to the cloud. Romain has an M.S. in Computer Science from Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Rennes, France.","location":"Grab R&D Center, 138 Cecil Street, Cecil Court, 069538, Singapore","rsvp_count":68,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-iOS-Dev-Scout-Meetup/events/234085621/","group_id":18566806,"group_name":"Singapore iOS Dev Scout Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-iOS-Dev-Scout-Meetup","formatted_time":"21 Sep 2016, Wed, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-09-21T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-09-21T13:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.279505,"longitude":103.848206},{"id":"233883634","name":"Monthly Meetup - 'Mobile RE Resiliency Testing' & 'Tracking Cybercriminals'","description":"Agenda: Introduction &amp; Networking Reverse Engineering Resiliency Testing in the OWASP MSTG by Bernhard Mueller Tracking Cyber Criminals by Fadli Abstract: Reverse Engineering Resiliency Testing in the OWASP MSTG Reverse engineering defenses are becoming a thing in the mobile world: Some vendors apply basic identifier renaming and string encryption in order protect their IP, others built whole obfuscated platforms to protect their users’ data. Advanced techniques like white-box cryptography and proprietary virtual machines are being applied in perfectly run-of-the-mill mobile apps.This is causing some confusion amongst security testers. It isn’t clear how, if at all, mobile apps are required to impede reverse engineering. Is it a vulnerability not to prevent debugging? How about root detection? How effective (if at all) are these techniques?In the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide, we attempt to define a practical, generic approach that testers can use to assess the effectiveness of a given set of obfuscations and reverse engineering defenses. The goal of this project is to enable testers to assess the level of RE resilience of an app, analogous to the way they use the CVSS score to quantify security risks. In this talk, I’ll introduce the OWASP MSTG, and discuss some of the ideas behind assessing reverse engineering resiliency. Tracking Cybercriminals Cyber scammers have been using social engineering techniques to manipulate the victims. Perhaps it’s time we should use the same technique against them and help the police bring them to justice. This talk aims to demonstrate on what hackers could actually do to assist the police to track down a cyber criminal through patience, time and dedication. It will also share the tools used and the techniques applied to gather all the necessary information, mapping and profiling the cyber scammer and importantly locating their location and how such process, methods and techniques can also be applied to unmask cyber criminals in the Dark Web. Speaker Bio: Bernhard Müller, Principal Security Consultant:Bernhard is an uncertified semi-ethical full-stack hacker with a talent in hacking all kinds of systems. During more than a decade in the industry he has found dozens of zero day flaws in widely used software, published attacks on core Internet protocols, and written award-winning papers. He is also a winner of BlackHat’s “Best Research” Pwnie Award. Fadli Sidek, Cyber Threat Intel Analyst:A comic geek, book worm and a security enthusiast that loves security and share to the community. Not an expert. Loves conferences and has shared his passion in Defcon Kerala, The Hackers Conference (New Delhi), BSides Las Vegas, BSides Vienna, Defcamp (Romania), Null Singapore, Defcon #SEVillage and business/corporate conferences and seminars.","location":"120 Robinson Road level 15, 120 Robinson Road level 15, Singapore","rsvp_count":114,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Null-Singapore-The-Open-Security-Community/events/233883634/","group_id":18493025,"group_name":"Null Singapore - The Open Security Community","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Null-Singapore-The-Open-Security-Community","formatted_time":"21 Sep 2016, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-09-21T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-09-21T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.352083,"longitude":103.819839},{"id":"234149059","name":"Azure and .NET UG meetup Sep 2016","description":"Session 1 (7 to 8 PM): Azure IoT Suite &amp; Windows 10 IoT-Core Learn about Azure IoT Suite and use Windows 10 IoT Core to create IoT solutions.
