There are absolutely no fees. Just come with an open mind and willingness to share and learn Agenda :  Introduction &amp; Networking Hacking Obfuscated Crypto Algorithms by Bernhard Muller Identifying Evil through Malware Funneling by Billy James Underlying vulnerable libraries: the overlooked security risk by Vanessa Henderson( Each talk is of 40 mins including 10 mins of Q&amp;A )  Abstract: Hacking Obfuscated Crypto Algorithms As data confidentiality is a big concern in a mobile environment, we increasingly see obfuscation and anti-tampering being applied to mobile apps. Techniques range from simple byte-code and binary obfuscation to virtualized containers and white-box cryptography. In this talk I’ll present some techniques we use when hacking these kind of apps and share some of my current research on obfuscated mobile implementations of encryption. Identifying Evil Through Malware Funneling Malware funneling is a methodology for finding and identifying evil from a huge data set. This aims to reduce / funnel files down to a few interesting (potentially *evil*) files, libraries and /or artifacts that we can further triage and analyze.  Underlying vulnerable libraries: the overlooked security risk We all use libraries without thinking twice if they are vulnerable or what they might be using under the hood. In a typical application, the 3rd party components and libraries make up a large part of the attack surface that hackers can exploit. In this talk, we will look at vulnerable libraries, how to find them. Many of these libraries are open-source and in languages like JavaScript developers often copy and paste code snippets between libraries. Re-usable code often leads to re-usable vulnerabilities. We will look at a detailed case study of a cross-site scripting vulnerability in Handlebars.js library and the impact it on a number of other projects. \n\n\n\nSpeaker Bio: Bernhard Muller Bernhard is an IT security guy who likes hacking all kinds of systems. He has found dozens of zero day flaws in widely used software, published attacks on core Internet protocols, and written some mind-blowing papers. He is also a winner of Blackhat’s Best Research Pwnie award. Currently Bernhard is driving development of the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide and leading security research at Vantage Point Security. Billy James Velasco  Billy James “Beejay” Velasco is currently an Incident Analyst for FireEye Inc, responsible for finding evil and solving computer crime across the global FaaS (FireEye as a Service) customer base.  Beejay Velasco most recently worked for Tyche Consulting Ltd. ROHQ where he led the implementation of an array of information security projects. Prior to Tyche, he served as a Level 3 Security Engineer for Emerson Electric (Asia) Ltd., where he was responsible for responding to network and endpoint security incidents; and providing tier-3 support to Emerson's global endpoint and network security solutions. He also spent 6 years at the Bank of the Philippine Islands, where he was the head of network security. He built and designed the bank's network security solutions; conducted security incident response, penetration testing, security audits, vulnerability assessments, and disaster recovery testing. He is a registered electronics and communications engineer and currently holds the CISSP and C|HFI among other certifications. \n\n\nVanessa Henderson Vanessa Henderson is a Security Researcher at SourceClear. She graduated from AUT University in Auckland, New Zealand with a Bachelors of Computing and Informational Sciences. Vanessa started with SourceClear as an intern in San Francisco, in less than a year she'd progressed to a Security Researcher and was moved to join the Research and Development team in Singapore in late 2015.  \n\nSee you all there!

This year, armed with a working prototype, she comes back to Singapore to showcase her robot design!\n\nGet your FREE tickets now via link above! http://ptix.co/1Yu8fBa\n\nBiography:\n\nTRYBOTS\n\nWe are a team making animal robots. All of the five members in it are 20 years old. Now we are making an underwater penguin robot \"MORUPEN\"and actually we made it swim with real penguins. Why can penguins swim so fast only with flapping their wings? Our First mission is to solve this question. We are developing it to make it close to the real penguin. The second mission is deploying underwater robot as a service robot. The flipping system is more safety and not tangled than screw system. So we believe underwater animal robot will succeed in places where duty and sharing with human.\n\nNao Kondo\n\nWhile in high school, Kondo founded the group with five teenage designers that developed a diving and swimming robot penguin, Morupen!, In 2013, Morupen! won an underwater robot competition, in the open segment, sponsored by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology. She is is currently studying robotics at elite Keio University, where she is a member of the aeronautics club and recently she got glider licence","location":"OneMaker Group - OMG, 111 Middle Road, #01-02, National Design Centre, Singapore 188969","rsvp_count":10,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1044133055634318","group_id":"289479571228137","group_name":"OneMaker Group - OMG","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/289479571228137","formatted_time":"18 May 2016, Wed, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2016-05-18T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-05-18T13:00:00.000Z","latitude":1.29891,"longitude":103.85319},{"id":"230604272","name":"May the Haskell be with you","description":"This month we have Yogesh to talk about the modeling Apache Spark with Haskell.
