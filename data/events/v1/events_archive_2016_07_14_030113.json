In the rapidly changing startup and technology market, great companies have the ability to respond and react to changes quicker than their competitors. Their edge is the ability to analyse data.\n\nThat is why data science and big data have become such a valuable skill to have in any company’s portfolio.\n\nWe have assembled a panel of speakers who will discuss their competitive edge at companies which utilise data science in smart ways. By the time you leave, you will equipped with knowledge, tools and resources to give your company a substantial edge in the competition.","location":"SCAPE HubQuarters, 2 Orchard Link #04-01, Singapore 237978","rsvp_count":84,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1630156680633951","group_id":711704195596196,"group_name":"General Assembly Singapore","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/711704195596196","formatted_time":"14 Jul 2016, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-07-14T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-07-14T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.30111,"longitude":103.8354899},{"id":"tpjvvlyvkbsb","name":"On-going: Functional Programming in Scala Coursera Study Group","description":"Study group for the Coursera Functional Programming in Scala Specialization, and all of it's courses.  Anyone may attend regardless of your progress in the courses.  We're here to help.

The \"How does it work?\" meetup was inspired by Guo Xiang's suggestion to have a meetup talk about how Sprockets actually works. \n\n\nAfter the first meetup we decided to vote about the topic for next month. The chosen option was Concurrent Ruby, a toolset that provides a bunch of higher-level abstractions for concurrency in Ruby. Concurrent Ruby is a big library, therefore we decided to pick just a part of it to discuss and learn together how it works \n\n\nPreparation 1. Download code from https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby 2. Read the description and code of promise feature. https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby/blob/master/lib/concurrent/promise.rb 3. Read the description and code of async feature. https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby/blob/master/lib/concurrent/async.rb \n\n\n\nMeetup plan We meet at 7.30pm and start by discussing how promises work. Everyone can participate, show some example and explain how the code works. Everyone can ask questions whenever something is not clear. Depending on the length of the first part, we'll try to cover async feature as well. \n\n\nVenue Sponsor  ","location":"Roomorama, 115 Amoy Street, #03-00, Singapore","rsvp_count":39,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Ruby-Group/events/232199906/","group_id":3952812,"group_name":"Singapore Ruby Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Ruby-Group","formatted_time":"14 Jul 2016, Thu, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2016-07-14T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-07-14T13:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.282097,"longitude":103.848022},{"id":"231984253","name":"Java Technology in Life Science world","description":"Muntasir Rahman, a technologist who is working for Thermo Fisher Scientific, a biotech company, will help us understand the role of technology within Life science domain, and what interesting problems they are trying to solve  Topics :  What are the problems to be solved in Life Science industry  What Java technologies  used  What skillsets are high in demand within this industry How is the future for technologist working in Biotech / Life Sciences ","location":"Pivotal's office, 53 Craig Road, #02-00 Singapore, 089691","rsvp_count":24,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Java-Technology-Meetup/events/231984253/","group_id":20056042,"group_name":"Singapore Java Technology Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Java-Technology-Meetup","formatted_time":"14 Jul 2016, Thu, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2016-07-14T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-07-14T12:15:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.27777,"longitude":103.842354},{"id":"232480158","name":"Native Hadoop Solution for Ingesting Big Data from Multiple Sources using Apex","description":"Presenter - Dr Sandeep Deshmukh, Committer Apache Apex, DataTorrent engineer Abstract:  Ingesting and extracting data from Hadoop can be a frustrating, time consuming activity for many enterprises. Apache Apex Data Ingestion is a standalone big data application that simplifies the collection, aggregation and movement of large amounts of data to and from Hadoop for a more efficient data processing pipeline. Apache Apex Data Ingestion makes configuring and running Hadoop data ingestion and data extraction a point and click process enabling a smooth, easy path to your Hadoop-based big data project. In this series of talks, we would cover how Hadoop Ingestion is made easy using Apache Apex. The first talk in this series would focus on ingesting unbounded file data. We will also give a brief overview of the Apex platform at the beginning of the session. Please register for the webinar at: https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/368563270490110724 After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the webinar. Apache Apex is a next generation native Hadoop data in motion platform that is being used by customers for both streaming as well as batch processing. Common use cases include ingestion into Hadoop, streaming analytics, ETL, database off-loads, alerts and monitoring, machine model scoring, etc. Apache Apex completely separates operational logic from business logic, and handles all operational aspects. This enables developers to concentrate on business logic and reduce time to market as well as total cost of ownership.  For deeper engagement with Apache Apex - follow ApacheApex, presentations, recordings, download (community, sandbox), Apache Apex releases, docs  This webcast is of an Big Data Ingest &amp; Transform meetup event done earlier in Pune, IN and we are webcasting it enable other Ingestors to participate. If you are interested in helping to organize (hosting, presenting, community leadership) the Big Data Ingest &amp; Transform (next gen Hadoop) community, please email &lt;a&gt;[masked]&lt;/a&gt; ","location":"Webcast, Online, Singapore","rsvp_count":18,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Ingest-Singapore/events/232480158/","group_id":20146922,"group_name":"Big Data (Next Gen Hadoop) Ingest & Transform, Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Big-Data-Ingest-Singapore","formatted_time":"14 Jul 2016, Thu, 10:30 pm","start_time":"2016-07-14T14:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-07-14T15:45:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.355379,"longitude":103.867744}]}
