While a flashy, user-facing solution might seem like a great idea, an outdated or inefficient back-end can trickle down into a subpar experience that even the best design can’t fix. Focusing only on the parts of an experience users can see and interact with can cost more in the long-term.  Join Associate UX Director Julie Kondo as she shares why investing in technology is as much a step toward good UX as creating a beautiful design. There will be snacks and drinks! Location: Huge's office is located at 33 Ann Siang Rd., Suite 31A.
