AgriLedger is a philanthropy initiative applying Distributed Cryptoledger (Blockchain) to create a circle of trust for small farmer co-operatives. It is a simple yet compelling application of blockchain for a completely different purpose. AgriLedger is a Mobile App that records and transacts incorruptible truth.  A complete framework of integrated services for delivering an even playing field for farmers and co-ops.  This solid framework of trust allows everyone to know they are working, buying, selling, and sharing things according to this cryptographic “Book of Truth” that is utterly incorruptible. The UN reports that up to 50% of crop value vanishes between harvest and the point of sale. Small cooperatives are currently by far the best way to improve efficiency in developing countries and help farmers retain a bigger share of their crop value. Co-ops presently rely on paper-based records, verbal promises, and complicated agreements; this frequently causes critical problems due to lack of transparency, restricted access to price data, lying, graft, and corruption.
