(Han Lim and Alan Menant) Testing is often neglected by developers. We are always trying to find a pretext not to test our apps - “it is too difficult”, “there is nothing to test”, “no time for that”, “can’t test with external dependencies” etc... . We will show you how to introduce testing to different aspects of your code so that you can instill confidence in yourself and others on the correctness of your programs. This session will be an introduction about applying TDD in your unit tests, writing good integration tests, incorporating front-end JS test and good / bad testing practices. After the presentation you’ll have no excuse for not testing your code like a pro. \n\n\n\nTalk 2: Operating a 16TB JVM... And Living to Tell the Tale (Nida Bouzid and Antoine Chambille) Is there a limit to the size of the heap the Java Virtual Machine can handle? Java blogs often report 100GB as the maximum amount of memory the JVM will manage effortlessly. Yet at Quartet FS we develop \"ActivePivot\", an In-Memory analytical platform written in pure Java and that is commonly deployed on a terabyte of memory. But the real story began when one of our customers challenged us to run a large credit risk use case on 16TB of memory. We managed to do it, but only when all the layers of the solution came together: data structures and thread management in the Java code, garbage collection in the JVM, memory management in the OS. In this presentation we will share all the steps to achieve this.","location":"PayPal office in Suntec, 5 Temasek Blvd, #09-01 Suntec Tower Five, 038985 Nearest Mrt:Promenade(Yellow Line), Singapore","rsvp_count":118,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/singasug/events/231984965/","group_id":13661682,"group_name":"Singapore Spring User Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/singasug","formatted_time":"20 Jul 2016, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-07-20T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-07-20T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.2945,"longitude":103.857964},{"id":"1655249851464757","name":"EML: Artistry [After Dark]","description":"Ready to enjoy new, original, live electronic music from six hot new electronic music artists, curated by the NUS Electronic Music Lab (based at NUS Centre For The Arts) over good food and drinks in a great venue Artistry Cafe?
