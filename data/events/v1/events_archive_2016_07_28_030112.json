This will also provide a networking platform for SMEs and startups to strike up conversations or initiate collaborations with A*STAR early career researchers (ECRs), and a perspective of the local market needs and economy directions for A*STAR ECRs.  \nComing up in July, Stem Cell Technology is the main theme and a group of speakers comprising commercialisation expert, scientist and local industry representative will be giving concise and interesting presentations on that day.\nDate & Time: July 28th Thursday 5.30-7.00pm\nVenue: A*START Central, Blk 79, Ayer Rajah Crescent, #05-01, JTC Launchpad (Opp Fusionopolis), Singapore 139955\nSchedule \n5.30-5.45pm\nTalk Title: Stem Cell Technlogies\nDr. Rahul Gopalkrishnan (Vice President of Biotechnology Commercialization Cluster, ETPL, A*STAR)\n\n\n\n\nDr. Gopalkrishnan is responsible for diverse life sciences and biotechnology, patenting and licensing projects, based on technologies developed in the A*STAR Research Institutes. \nHis career path started off with lab research which led into patenting his biotech research inventions. This was followed by immersion in patent law, in a law firm and his present focus on industry engagement and technology transfer. \n\n\n\n\n5.45-6.00pm\nTalk Title: Modeling Diabetes using Stem Cell Derived Pancreatic Beta Cells\nDr. Jamie Trott (Research Fellow, IMB, A*STAR)\n\n\nDr. Jamie Trott is currently a research fellow in the lab of Dr Ray Dunn at the Institute of Medical Biology (IMB), A*STAR, Singapore. The Insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas are responsible for maintaining normal blood glucose levels, and their failure leads to diabetes.\nDr. Trott is currently developing in vitro differentiation protocols for generating functional beta cells from human pluripotent stem cells. Such protocols will enable the generation of sufficient beta cells for transplantation into diabetic patients whose own beta cells are no longer functional. Furthermore, the ability to generate patient-specific beta cells in vitro will facilitate crucial studies into how and why beta cells fail in diabetes. To this end Dr. Trott is currently generating beta cells from a number of diabetic patients to identify genetic and physiological defects leading to beta cell failure. Prior to joining A*STAR, Dr. Trott obtained his PhD in stem cell biology in the lab of Prof Alfonso Martinez-Arias (Cambridge University) and studied biochemistry at Imperial College London. \n6.00-6.15pm\nTalk Title: Scientists Helping Scientist\nMs. Jacqueline Ng (Regional Sales Manager, STEMCELL Technologies Inc.)\n\n\nMs. Jacqueline Ng is a Regional Sales Manager with STEMCELL Technologies Inc. She has been with the company since 2009 and oversees a team of technical sales representatives and distributors in South East Asia. She also scouts for innovative technologies in Singapore and has facilitated over ten scientific collaborations between local researchers and STEMCELL’s scientists. Prior to joining STEMCELL, Jacqueline reviewed primary healthcare policies at the Ministry of Health (Singapore).

This talk aims to provide a breakdown of how several old Windows vulnerabilities can be chained together to escalate privilege, and bring awareness to the danger of default configurations Local Privilege Escalation – From Hero to UID 0. Although “getting shell” is often the goal of any seasoned hacker, in reality that shell will have low privileges, with limited access to the local host or the real treasures it may hold. To truly become a master of your domain you must be able to become UID 0 or NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM through a technique known as local privilege escalation. This presentation will delve into the many methods of privilege escalation that exist in both Windows and Unix Systems and show just how easy it is go from hero to UID 0.

Texturally complex and visceral, The Observatory’s music crosses wasted borders to parallel polarities within human existence, provoking and inspiring in a deeply enigmatic way.\n\n In this special edition of ArtScience Late, The Observatory presents an installation-performance that draws attention to the aspirations and desires of some of our own island-city folke with recorded interviews, premeditated frequencies and music. Taking inspiration from the theme behind their album Oscilla; The Observatory delves into the desire to live off-grid as a reaction to today's consumerist society. Despite modern-day difficulties, a growing number of people across the civilised world have elected to pursue and embrace a lifestyle motivated by ethics.  Given the unrelenting pressures of contemporary life and the scale of environmental devastation, it is no wonder the yearning to escape will only get stronger.","location":"ArtScience Museum, 10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956","rsvp_count":176,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/297141834009681","group_id":"156726297714355","group_name":"ArtScience Museum","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/156726297714355","formatted_time":"28 Jul 2016, Thu, 8:00 pm","start_time":"2016-07-28T12:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-07-28T14:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.28168,"longitude":103.85876}]}
