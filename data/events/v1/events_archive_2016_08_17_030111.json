Josh is a Java Champion, author of 5 books (including O'Reilly's upcoming Cloud Native Java: Designing Resilient Systems with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Cloud Foundry)  “It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.” -W. Edwards Deming Work takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It’s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software - for many organizations and industries - is a competitive advantage. Organizations break their larger software ambitions into smaller, independently deployable, feature -centric batches of work - microservices. In order to reduce the round-trip between stations of work, organizations collapse or consolidate as much of them as possible and automate the rest; developers and operations beget “devops,” cloud-based services and platforms (like Cloud Foundry) automate operations work and break down the need for ITIL tickets and change management boards. But velocity, for velocity’s sake, is dangerous. Microservices invite architectural complexity that few are prepared to address. In this talk, we’ll look at how high performance organizations like Ticketmaster, Alibaba, and Netflix make short work of that complexity with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.","location":"PayPal office in Suntec, 5 Temasek Blvd, #09-01 Suntec Tower Five, 038985 Nearest Mrt:Promenade(Yellow Line), Singapore","rsvp_count":120,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/singasug/events/233028592/","group_id":13661682,"group_name":"Singapore Spring User Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/singasug","formatted_time":"17 Aug 2016, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-08-17T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-08-17T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.2945,"longitude":103.857964},{"id":"1072933062742171","name":"IGDA x Facebook","description":"We're teaming up with Facebook to try a slightly different IGDA event this time, looking at how some developers successfully use Facebook to market their games and studios, and doing a series of 1:1 consultations with developers interested in optimizing the Facebook presence. \n\n\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT\nJoin us at Facebook Singapore to learn how your game can be discovered on Facebook.

The \"How does it work?\" meetup was inspired by Guo Xiang's suggestion to have a meetup talk about how Sprockets actually works. In our previous meetings we learned about Sprockets and Concurrent Ruby. This is our 3rd meetup and this time we'll dig into the code of Rack library. Rack (http://rack.github.io) is the most popular web server interface for Ruby libraries. It powers most of the Ruby web frameworks (Rails, Sinatra, Volt, Roda). Although used by many, Rack is understood by few people, and we'll change it a bit by learning how it works. Preparation Rack is quite a big library, therefore we'll focus on just 2 parts: server and handler. To prepare for the meetup: 1. Watch Aaron Patterson's presentation from RubyConf Taiwan 2015 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5AaZRVhecI - start from 24:00) 2. Read Rack handler's code: a) handler's selection (https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/handler.rb) b) example handler, let's use Webrick: (https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/handler/webrick.rb) 3. Read Rack server's code (https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/server.rb) 4. Play with the code - write a simple Rack application, run it, try to see what happens when you do it. 5. Prepare some small snippet of code that you can show to other people - it can be either very small app, or some call of Rack internals that you find interesting. \n\n\nSee you soon!","location":"Tinkerbox Studios, 113B Jalan Besar, 208833, Singapore","rsvp_count":13,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Ruby-Group/events/233082612/","group_id":3952812,"group_name":"Singapore Ruby Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Ruby-Group","formatted_time":"17 Aug 2016, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-08-17T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-08-17T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.30627,"longitude":103.855766}]}
